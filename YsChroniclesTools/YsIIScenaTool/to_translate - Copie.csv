A favorite of Zava's due to
its unmatched abilities.";

energy from its eye to
decimate its victims. Since
physical attacks are inef-
fective, those with no magic
are doomed in its wake.";

chosen elemental. With its
one eye and strong back legs

the appearance of a giant's
severed head. Approaches
its prey slowly, occasion-

with this!";

waiting for the day our duty could
be fulfilled.";

"2f8db";"I'm sorry to keep bothering you,
Adol, but would you go tell him?";
"2f923";"I believe I saw him preparing her grave
earlier. Someone had best let him know,
before he throws himself in it!";
"2f999";"I can't tell you how relieved I am
to know that Maria is safe. Has Sada
heard the good news yet?";

though, I imagine.";

will. He'll be fine.";

underground was actually Sada himself...";

"2fb07";"I see. So you were able to cure the
petrification...";
"2fb43";"Adol, I beg of you, please save him!";
"2fb6f";"So what in the world could have happened
to Sada?!";
"2fba9";"I see. So you were able to cure the
petrification...";
"2fbe5";"Adol, please! Is there no way to undo
the curse? I refuse to believe there
isn't! I will never accept that!";
"2fc57";"Hmm... Based on what you've told me, it
seems reasonable to conclude that the
statue you saw may be Sada himself.";
"2fccf";"As long as he has that sword,
I believe he'll be able to
handle anything he finds.";
"2fd29";"His swordsmanship is quite
renowned in this village.";

have happened to Sada?!";
"2fd9b";"It seems he went to rescue Maria
from the sacrificial ceremony...";
"2fde3";"Sada has disappeared, and so has
the sword which serves as our
family heirloom.";
"2fe39";"This is surely the blessing of the
Goddesses. Sada will be overjoyed!";
"2fe85";"Words cannot convey how relieved
I am that she is alive and well.";
"2fecd";"...";
"2fed7";"It was foolish of him to enter the
Shrine on his own...but I can't really
blame him, considering the situation.";
"2ff4d";"If he had been here, Sada would've
given his life to protect her.";
"2ff95";"Sada was out on patrol on the day they
attacked, so he wasn't around to put up
a fight. Which he certainly would've.";
30011;"Maria is Sada's fiancee. Three days
ago, she was taken by the demons.";
"3005d";"No one knows quite why, but around
six months ago, demons began pouring
out from the Shrine of Solomon.";
"300cb";"We'd been living peacefully here
since Ys rose into the sky seven
hundred years ago.";
30127;"Ramia Village prospered in the shadow
of the Shrine gates.";
30169;"If we should try to fight back, they'd
raze the village to the ground without
the slightest effort. We can only hide.";
"301e5";"They are powerful, after all. And they
vastly outnumber us.";
30227;"We've established a lookout post in
front of the Shrine now, to give us
advance warning if the demons attack.";
"3029b";"If control of the Shrine were taken back
from the demons, all of Ys may be saved.
And I believe you are the man to do it!";
"3031b";"As I understand it, though, the true way
in is right by the Shrine's entrance...";
30373;"It's an area of great power, and is
thus considered off-limits, and placed
under heavy guard.";
"303d7";"At the heart of the Shrine is a
royal chamber wherein the twin
Goddesses once resided.";
30435;"It's basically a giant labyrinth, and no
one knows quite how to find anything in
there. Plus, it's teeming with demons!";
"304b3";"It was once a shrine to the Goddesses.
The royal chamber is near the bell
tower, and the layout is sectioned.";
30527;"Even now, I still remember it as if it
were yesterday. As dusk hit, it felt
like the sky was stained with blood...";
"305a1";"Marle and her brother were both killed.
Marle's remains were found at her home,
but her brother's body was missing.";
"3061b";"The day the demons began attacking us,
six months ago...";
"3065b";"It's been half a year, but it's still a
painful memory. Two innocent people
lived in that house...and died there...";
"306d5";"Ah, Adol! So glad to see you
in one piece!";
30707;"Is that the #c2#Cleria Sword#c# I see
in your hands? I assume Sada
gave it to you...";
30763;"#c2#Adol described his meeting with
Sada to Hadat.";
"3079d";"Since Sada has entrusted the sword
to you, please allow me to augment
the set.";
"307f3";"I see... Thank goodness...";
30815;"Adol, I pray that your battle will
end in victory. If you need my help
with anything, do not hesitate to ask.";
30889;"Seven hundred years ago, Ys became a
sort of ark in the sky, if you will...
and we've been floating here ever since.";
30905;"If only I had the Cleria Shield
to give you, as well...";
30943;"That sword and armor will serve you
quite well. I'm sure of it.";
30989;"Both were entrusted to us for the sole
purpose of one day being handed down to
the hero led by the twin Goddesses.";
"30a03";"This is Cleria Armor, which my family
preserved alongside the sword.";
"30a4f";"Is there something you needed?";
"30a75";"Old man #c2#Regg#c# might be able to
understand you, but all I hear
are adorable whimpers!";
"30ad7";"Are you...Adol? I'm sorry, but I don't
speak the language of the beasts.
You'll need to approach me as a human.";
"30b4d";"Old man #c2#Regg#c# might be able to
understand you, but all I hear
are adorable whimpers!";
"30baf";"Yes, yes, you're very cute, Ado-roo.
But nothing will be accomplished if
I can't make out a word you're saying!";
"30c25";"Disguised as one of their own,
the beasts will surely let you
into the Shrine of Solomon!";
"30c85";"Interesting power you've got there!";
"30caf";"Hmm? You're no ordinary Roo, are you...
I see, so it's you, Adol...";
"30cf9";"One of the sacred creatures appearing
before us can only be a good omen. Who's
a good omen? You are! Yes, you are!";
"30d73";"Hmm... A demon? No, far too cute for
that. You're clearly a Roo! Just about
the age for breeding, too, I'd say...";
"30deb";"The legend has been silenced
for seven hundred years. But
now, the story has an end...";
"30e49";"Ys has descended to the ground.";
"30e6f";"I guess it's important to have faith in
the power of youth. You've come so far,
there's simply no turning back now!";
"30ee9";"Honestly, you, Sada and Tarf are
all the same. Reckless, careless
and headache-inducing, the lot of you!";
"30f59";"I took my eyes off of him for
just one moment, and off he went!
That wily Tarf...";
"30fb1";"I believe that your quest will end in
victory. But if I may be of some help
along the way, it would be my pleasure.";
"3102b";"We have a lively young guest
waiting for you, Adol.";
31065;"Do you need anything, Adol?";
31087;"Do you need anything, Adol?";
"310a9";"Come again, anytime!";
"310c5";"Can I help you with something?";
"310eb";"You have the eyes of one who's
seen many things, yet always
desires to see more.";
31143;"Ah, a traveling swordsman.";
31165;"Mister Adol, you're toooo sloooow!
C'mon! Hurry it up, already!";
"311ab";"I was being all brave and sneaky, and
followed him all the way here!";
"311f7";"I saw that guy in the black cloak, just
outside the village.";
"3123b";"So, like, it happened right after you
left.";
"3126d";"It seems like the demons really have it
in for you, too, mister. You've been put
through a lot!";
"312d3";"Mister Adol, I'd watch out for that guy
if I were you. He's real bad news!";
31325;"I lost sight of him, though, just after
arriving in this village.";

followed him all the way here!";

usually white...?";
31509;"What's wrong, mister?";
31525;"...Uhh...";
31535;"In that case, I have it...um...";
"3155b";"...Oh! Is that what you call that stone
you gave me, when you got me outta
that cave?";
"315b7";"...Or not...?";
"315cb";"I have it right here...ish...";
"315ef";"That stone was so small, too... I dunno
if I could possibly find it now. Don't
even know where I dropped it!";
31663;"Oh, crap! There's a
hole in my pocket!";
31691;"I'm really sorry, mister! I hope it
wasn't super-important or anything...";
"316e1";"I was playing around with it in my
pocket when I talked to that guy with
the funny eyes... You know, the guard?";
31757;"I had it when I got to the village, that
much I know.";
31793;"#c2#Adol told Tarf not to worry, and
reassured him that the Black Pearl
would surely be found soon.";

got here, maybe somebody found it and
picked it up. That's what I'm hoping!";

that guy if I were you. He's
real bad news!";

Anyway, I'm hungry now,
how about you?";

thingy!";

fursuit again, I see!";

some sunbathing with my
husband next time...";

warmer lately.";

You're her only hope!";

even know she was sick, much
less how bad it was.";

Lilia of her illness.";

so hard on behalf of
this village.";

you can't do it.";

parties, thankyouverymuch!";

land! And water! Where before, there
was sky! We're...back on the surface!";

things, so I went out to have a look...";

Now I can have some peace
and quiet again!";

the demons from my basement?";

once in a while.";

Now, why in the world
would that be happening?!";
"326ab";"Ugh, not again...";

fully exposing me to the demons, should
be the one to set things right...no?";

see it, you can ring that bell to
make it show its ugly face.";

demons are drawn toward the sound
of it, from far and wide.";

that accursed bell in my
basement...";

basement be free again?
When, I ask, when?!";

in my basement...";

can have some peace and
quiet again.";

to come back, feel free.";

again! Demons in my basement-- a whole
mess of 'em!";

who knows his way around a sword.
You mind getting rid of 'em for me?";

amiss down there?";

been seriously creepy noises coming
from my basement.";

than not being bothered.";

in the sky than they've ever been
before. How could that be?!";
33373;"Where on Ys could our Lilia have
gotten herself off to...?";
"333b5";"Come to think of it, Bohtz was saying
that Lilia was nowhere to be found
after everyone was captured...";
33423;"I'm just glad that Bohtz
got back safely.";
33453;"Banoa's daughter, Lilia, has also
vanished. I don't like this...";
"3349b";"Bohtz, the miner, hasn't
been seen for a while.";
"334d1";"So you're the one who brought
us the ore, are you? Thanks
muchly for your help!";
33527;"Now that he can start smithing
again, my husband's gone right
back to his old, chipper self.";
"3358b";"I can't bear to see
him like this...";
"335b7";"My husband is an armorsmith, but he
hasn't been able to work for some time
on account of his iron ore running low.";
33631;"Ack! Aieee!";
33643;"With my dad here, I don't have
anything to be scared of!";
33683;"Oookay, time to study!";
"336a1";"He always looks happy when I
tell him I wanna be like him
when I grow up.";
"336f1";"Heh. I've been talking to
my dad a lot about armor-
smithing lately.";
"3373d";"I'm really, really not sure
what to think right now...";
"3377b";"I want him to train me, so
I can be an armorsmith too
when I grow up!";
"337c7";"Dad looks so cool when he's
making armor! He's all focused
and serious...";
33817;"I hate seeing him like that.
On numerous levels!";
"3384f";"All he does now is wander
the village like a loon...";
"3388b";"Dad's a really good armorsmith, but
he hasn't been able to make armor for
a while because he has no iron.";
"338fb";"Bite me and you're dead.";
"3391b";"I've got special armor on.";
"3393d";"Nothing makes a man feel
complete like the sense
of a job well done.";
33989;"Oh, so you're the one who brought
me the Iron Ore, are you?";
"339cb";"Frankly, I'm elated. I never thought
I'd have the opportunity to see a man
in full Cleria Armor standing before me.";
"33a45";"Such exquisite craftsmanship...";
"33a6b";"It's so shiny...and the color...
Is that...Cleria Armor?!";
"33aab";"H...hey. Your armor...";
"33ac9";"Brace yourself, Adol. It's a
bumpy road ahead.";
"33aff";"The task before you is a great
one, which may shake the very
foundations of Ys.";
"33b55";"A swordsman of Cleria...";
"33b75";"Of course, it's just a legend, so it
may not even be real. But if it is...
Oh, what I would give to see it!";
"33be7";"It's called Cleria Armor, and is
made from a legendary metal unlike
any other.";
"33c3d";"By the way, have you heard about
the legendary suit of armor?
Supposedly exists somewhere in Ys...";
"33ca7";"Take a look around Ys, and see
for yourself what it's like.";
"33ce9";"Not everyone is as skilled with a blade
as you...and no one else dares set foot
outside the village, as you'd imagine.";
"33d67";"Looks like you've been
wandering pretty far
afield.";
"33da1";"If you should happen to find any
Iron Ore, bring it to Guido. He'll
pay you a handsome sum for it!";
"33e0b";"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";
"33e59";"Go pick on someone
else next time.";
"33e83";"I've been attacked by
demons once already.";
"33eb5";"Please leave me be.";
"33ecf";"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";
"33f1d";"I have a wife and two
young daughters.";
"33f4b";"Please, spare me.";
"33f63";"Go on, you should get back
to the village. Banoa will be
delighted to see you!";
"33fb9";"Thank goodness! Where did you
go after you disappeared down
in that canal?";
"3400b";"Lilia's been found?!";
34027;"It's all because of you, Adol,
that I've been reunited with my
family. Thank you so very much!";
"3408d";"Banoa must be worried sick!";
"340af";"On that note, where did Lilia go?
Did you find her?!";
"340eb";"When the demons caught me in the Shrine,
I thought I was done for. I'll have to
be more careful from now on.";
"3415f";"The demons down there are pretty
light on brains, so they don't
pose all that much of a threat.";
"341c5";"Oh, there were demons there... That
hasn't changed. But if you stay on
your guard, they're easy to deal with.";
34239;"I was just down in the Rasteenie
Mine earlier. Hadn't been there
in quite some time.";
34295;"I wonder if I should stock up on
weapons and armor at Guido's, and
head down into the mine...";
"342f9";"I wouldn't want to worry my wife
and little girls, though...so I
guess I'll show some self-restraint.";
34365;"I've just been itching to get back
into Rasteenie for the last little
while...";
"343bb";"My wife worries about me because of all
the demons, so I've been keeping my eye
on the situation for a while now.";
34433;"Actually, I'm going to the
mine with Flair to look
for Herbs and Iron Ore.";
34485;"I hear you rescued Dr. Flair.
You have no idea how much we
appreciate that.";
"344d7";"If there's anything
you're curious about,
feel free to ask.";
34519;"I know a bit more about
Rasteenie Mine than other
folks do.";
"3455b";"Hey! What the hell
are you doing?!";
34585;"I suppose as long as my husband
is at my side, I can face whatever
this world throws at me...";
"345e9";"So, Ys is back on the surface...
Now what?";
"3461b";"I hear you're the one who
rescued him. Words cannot
express my gratitude!";
"3466b";"My dear husband has returned!";
"3468f";"All I can do now is pray
that he's safe, wherever
he may be.";
"346d3";"Oh, dear... Where could my
husband have gotten himself
off to?!";
34719;"There's a rumor going around that the
demons are kidnapping people. And I must
say, I don't much care for that rumor!";
34795;"My husband hasn't returned
from Rasteenie Mine yet...";
"347d1";"But I do still worry about him. I
mean, he is my husband, after all!";
"3481d";"My husband agreed not to do anything
that would put him in danger, so I gave
him my blessing to go back to his work.";
34899;"But both have been swarming
with demons lately, so the
going is...not easy!";
"348eb";"It's his job to look for Herbs and
Iron Ore in the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine and the Ruins of Moondoria.";
34959;"My husband is a miner.";
34977;"Demons are scaaary...";
34993;"Scaaary.";
"349a3";"But Mom is kinda scary too...";
"349c7";"Scarier!";
"349d7";"So I'm scared, but less scared
than as scared as I could be
scared. Scared. I like that word!";
"34a3b";"So yeah. Sorry. You're less
scary than Mom.";
"34a6d";"How did we get back on
the surface?!";
"34a99";"Land down! LAND DOWN!";
"34ab5";"There's water EVERYWHERE!";
"34ad5";"Amaaaaazing...";
"34aeb";"They call it the 'sea.'";
"34b09";"...They do?";
"34b1b";"Let's go swimming!";
"34b35";"Let's go fishing!";
"34b4d";"Daddy's home!";
"34b61";"He came back!";
"34b75";"He went to the Shrine, right?";
"34b99";"Oh, yeah...";
"34bab";"He didn't bring souvenirs!";
"34bcd";"He's a meanie!";
"34be3";"Daddy's still not back yet...";
"34c07";"I bet he's not comin'...";
"34c27";"I want him back NOW!";
"34c43";"Right now!";
"34c55";"I hope he brings souvenirs!";
"34c77";"Big ones!";
"34c87";"Like maybe some jewels!";
"34ca5";"Or money!";
"34cb5";"We're twiiins!";
"34ccb";"Twiiins!";
"34cdb";"Even our dad can't
tell us apart!";
"34d03";"Can't tell! Can't tell!";
"34d21";"Our mother can't tell
us apart, either!";
"34d4f";"Can't tell! Can't tell!";
"34d6d";"Even we can't tell
each other apart!";
"34d99";"Nope! Can't tell!";
"34db1";"Wait... Is that true?
We can tell each other
apart just fine, big sis!";
"34dff";"No, I'm the little sis!";
"34e1d";"Oh, yeah, I guess you are...";
"34e41";"Demons are scaaary...";
"34e5d";"Scaaary.";
"34e6d";"But Mom is kinda scary too...";
"34e91";"Scarier!";
"34ea1";"So I'm scared, but less scared
than as scared as I could be
scared. Scared. I like that word!";
"34f05";"So yeah. Sorry. You're less
scary than Mom.";
"34f37";"Daddy's home!";
"34f4b";"He came back!";
"34f5f";"He went to the Shrine, right?";
"34f83";"Oh, yeah...";
"34f95";"He didn't bring souvenirs!";
"34fb7";"He's a meanie!";
"34fcd";"Daddy's still not back yet...";
"34ff1";"I bet he's not comin'...";
35011;"I want him back NOW!";
"3502d";"Right now!";
"3503f";"I hope he brings souvenirs!";
35061;"Big ones!";
35071;"Like maybe some jewels!";

"351e9";"No, I'm the little sis!";
35207;"Oh, yeah, I guess you are...";
"3522b";"Aiiieeeeee!";
"3523d";"The days have been warmer
lately, which we old folks
certainly don't mind.";
"3528f";"Ah, well. When you get to be my age,
sonny, you'll find you don't worry too
much about things like demons anymore!";
35309;"Seems like the demons have been
multiplying like rabbits these
days. There are just soooo many...";
35371;"There's something about you,
lad. The Goddesses must smile
upon you.";
"353bd";"It's so good of you to have
helped Lilia like you did.
Thank you so much!";
"3540d";"You seem like a nice young man.
You should rest and recuperate.
Maybe then it'll come to you!";
35471;"...Oh. You don't remember?";
35493;"Aren't you the one who was found
unconscious, in the field? Why on
Ys were you there in the first place?!";
35503;"Beware the follies of youth, young man.
Being young means feeling like you're
invincible. But know this: You aren't.";
"3557f";"Aaaaaaaagggh!";
35593;"I've never actually seen a
demon, but I'll bet they're
pretty scary.";
"355df";"I'm not afraid of any demons.
If they came into this village,
I'd show 'em what's what!";
"3563d";"It's such a relief to
hear that she's okay.";
"3566f";"It's nice to hear some good news
these days. We don't get that very
often anymore.";
"356c9";"So, you're the young man who
saved Lilia's life, are you?";
35709;"Damnable demons! If it weren't
for them, Ys would be a veritable
paradise!";
"3575b";"All the depressing rumors flying
around lately have been getting
me down...";
"357ad";"Eeeeeeeeek!";
"357bf";"I actually saw a demon with my own
eyes a short while ago. It really
was just as scary as they say!";
35829;"...Cute demon. But still a
demon. 'Eek' IS the proper
response, no?";
35873;"My man is a good man.
A reliable man. A real
man's man!";
"358b1";"What a splendid lad you are!";
"358d5";"You say you went into the
mines to help Lilia?";
"3590b";"Nice job! I know someone
who will be very, very
happy to see it.";
35953;"You found some Iron Ore?";
35973;"Since we can't look for medicinal
herbs or mine for ore as a result,
prices are very much on the rise.";
"359e1";"The old Rasteenie Mine has become
far too dangerous to enter these
days, thanks to the demons.";
"35a47";"...You hungry, little guy?";
"35a69";"Dearie dearie dearie...";
"35a87";"Oh, dear...";
"35a99";"I wasn't worried!";
"35ab1";"Hmm? Did something happen?";
"35ad3";"He sometimes gets in the way,
but I put up with him.";
"35b0f";"Leggs is here today.
How unusual!";
"35b37";"Where on Ys could that Lilia
have run off to?! Poor Banoa
must be worried sick!";
"35b8d";"Back safe, you say?
Fantastic!";
"35bb3";"When I first heard that Bohtz
had disappeared, I thought my
heart was going to stop!";
"35c0f";"Nice and warm lately. Makes me
want to sit out in the sun and
toast my skin a bit...";
"35c6b";"Hope it's good tidings.
I'm sick of the bad sort!";
"35ca3";"There seems to be quite a
commotion in the village,
wouldn't you say?";
"35cef";"Hello. The master of the house isn't
in right now, I'm afraid. But do make
yourself at home, if you wish.";
"35d5f";"Astal and old man Leggs both
live here, though they're not
related to one another.";
"35db9";"Me? I'm Master Astal's
housekeeper.";
"35de3";"Hello. The masters of the house aren't
in right now, I'm afraid. But do make
yourself at home, if you wish.";
"35e55";"If you need to see them for
something, I guarantee that's
where you'll find them.";
"35ead";"Astal and Leggs are almost always
in the Ruins of Moondoria, day in
and day out. They're obsessed!";"Ouroboros姐夫你好"
"35f17";"Wha...? You look like a demon,
but...you're not, are you? You
somehow strike me as human...";
"35f79";"I'm almost always in Moondoria, but
even Moondoria fanatics have to eat,
right? So, I come home to eat!";
"35fe7";"As you've probably guessed,
this is my home.";
"3601b";"Oh, it's you, is it?";
36037;"#c2#A sense of evil permeates
this place.#c#";
"3606b";"Oooh... Which one should
I go with...?";
36099;"...Huh?! Oh, crap... Was I talking
in my sleep again?!";
"360d7";"If that hole hadn't opened
up, we'd've been stuck in
there for good!";
36123;"Haven't seen you before,
stranger. Who might you
be?";
"3615f";"You know what they say... Walk a
thousand miles, then walk a thousand
more. It's all about getting started!";
"361d1";"I'm not really sure what I mean by
that-- I do tend to ramble-- but, you
know...roar, bare fangs, and all that!";
36247;"I just keep meeting new people
lately. Yesiree, I'm a popular
one! I must be a looker!";
"362a5";"No clue why anything that happens
happens. It's a mystery!";
"362e7";"I always get sleepy on the job,
no matter how much sleep I
actually get the night before.";
36347;"Adol...";
36355;"While you wait for her return, you may
feel free to rest here for as long as
you'd like.";
"363b5";"I suspect she's gone off in search of a
means to lend you her aid.";
"363ff";"Don't worry about Lilia, Adol. I have
faith in that child.";
36441;"I wonder where she could have gone...
I hope she's all right...";
36487;"Adol, have you seen my daughter? I'm
saddened to say she's disappeared.";
"364d5";"He made a silent oath to find some way
of returning her to normal.";
"3651f";"Adol couldn't bring himself to tell
Banoa of Lilia's fate.";
36561;"I wonder where she could have gone...
I hope she's all right...";
"365a7";"Adol, have you seen my daughter? I'm
saddened to say she's disappeared.";
"365f5";"From now on, you may come here to rest
whenever you'd like, for as long as you
wish!";
36651;"You've saved my daughter's life!";
36679;"How can I ever thank you, Adol?";
"3669f";"With this medicine, Lilia's illness
will be a thing of the past. It's
practically a miracle!";
36703;"How can I ever thank you, Adol?";
36729;"Truly, with this medicine, Lilia shall
live to see another day!";
"3676f";"...Thank the Goddesses! You have no idea
what a hero you are to her, and to me as
well!";
"367cd";"Is that...the medicine to cure my
daughter's illness? Truly?!";
36811;"If you need to recuperate before you go,
there's always a place for you here.
Come by anytime.";
36877;"And since you did rescue Dr. Flair,
I can honestly say that I have every
confidence in your abilities.";
"368e5";"Will you seek them out, Adol? I hate to
ask so much of you, but you're her only
hope!";
36941;"According to him, we need two ingre-
dients for the medicine to cure Lilia
of her illness...";
"369a5";"Thank you for saving Dr. Flair.";
"369cb";"Thank you, Adol, for saving Dr. Flair.";
"369f9";"Rasteenie Mine is a pit of danger.
It was only a matter of time before
something like this happened...";
"36a67";"How dreadful... Although gifted in
medicine, Dr. Flair needs to exercise
better judgment when picking herbs!";
"36adb";"You mustn't strain yourself. Recover
fully, THEN proceed on whatever quest
you've undertaken.";
"36b3f";"Should you really be up and about
already? Your wounds are still fresh!";

actions will ultimately determine
the course of this land's destiny.";

they're extremely significant...but
in what way? That's the question!";

floating in the sky for seven
hundred years.";

look around the village, if you'd like!";

collapsed near a place we call the

dangerous, you see, so we keep

In its heyday, though, it flourished
under the jurisdiction of the Priests.";

ask me. Wounds do heal, but broken necks
do not.";
37993;"There are medicinal herbs to be found
within the abandoned mine, and some
still attempt to find them on occasion.";
"37a0b";"You're actually quite precious to us--
even though we've only known you for a
short time.";

safety. As have I. We don't wish to see
any harm fall upon you, Adol Christin!";

the demons, however.";

heart, for the lengths you've gone to
on Lilia's behalf.";

the Celceta Flower for her? The poor
girl doesn't even know she's sick...";

the depths of the old Mine. We must have
it in order to make medicine for Lilia.";

there six months ago, all of that's
changed...";

there'll always be a bed and a hot

careful, Adol! Don't get hurt!";
"37e19";"Dr. Flair is trapped in the abandoned
mine?!";

to assist in his rescue?";
"37e93";"Dr. Flair is trapped in the abandoned
mine?!";
"37ec7";"Dr. Flair still goes down to pick herbs
every now and again, though-- despite
our best efforts to convince him not to!";
"37f45";"But ever since the demons showed up...
well, even our half-hearted version of
mining has seemed far less viable.";
"37fbd";"Iron ore and herbs are quite abundant
around such spots. We'd often gather
them, and call it 'mining.'";

the mine tunnels at Rasteenie...";

to cope with the horrors that continue
to plague us here...";
"381e1";"My husband passed away when Lilia was
very young, so it's just been the two of
us for most of her life.";
"3824f";"I'll wait here for her. I know she'll be
home before long, and I don't want the
house to be empty when she gets here!";
"382cb";"Knowing her as I do, I believe she must
be on a personal mission to help you, as
best as she can.";
38333;"Yes...";
38341;"You found Lilia? And she's okay?! Oh,
thank the Goddesses! And thank you, too,
for letting me know!";
"383ab";"If she wants to put herself in danger
for your sake...well, I know her well
enough to say that she's unstoppable!";
38423;"Lilia owes you her life.";
38443;"Oh, Lilia... Where could you have gone?!";
38473;"She was seen briefly at the village
gate, but not once since then.";
"384bd";"She left a while ago... Mentioned
something about going to the Ruins.";
38509;"If so, then I suppose it would be
fruitless to ask you to remain here,
and keep an old woman company...no?";
"3857b";"Lilia believes that you have some great
mission you must carry out.";
"385c5";"Yet, in spite of that, she never once
let it show...for my sake.";
"3860d";"Apparently, Lilia DID know she was sick,
after all...";
38649;"Now we have the medicine, and Lilia is
saved! Thank you, Adol. You're like an
angel of mercy!";
"386ad";"If she's to die from this, at least
she'll die happy.";
"386e9";"...I haven't said anything. I don't have
the heart! It would do her no good to
know.";
38745;"How can fate be so cruel as to inflict
the same malady upon her?!";
"3878d";"His ran its course much more quickly,
however. And was far more severe.";
"387db";"Lilia's illness is the same one that
took her father from me...";
38821;"She took a basket with her, so I believe
she's picking apples. If you go out for
a walk, you may run into her.";
38897;"Lilia's out at the moment.";
"388b9";"If there's anything you wish to know,
feel free to ask.";
"388f7";"I can't ask you to stay within the
village, but I can and will ask you
to be wary of the demons!";
"3895f";"Are you honestly feeling better? Don't
lie to me! If you're still injured, you
should rest...";
"389c3";"...That's what I started thinking,
anyway. After you saved me. It was
like...an epiphany, I guess.";
"38a2d";"After all, there must be a reason
for the demons to have resurfaced
after so many hundreds of years...no?";
"38a9d";"I mean, certainly, defeating the demons
would be better than not...but I don't
think they're the underlying issue here.";
"38b1b";"Everyone says that if there were no
demons, we could all be happy and at
peace, but...I'm not sure that's true!";
"38b91";"Just think what might have happened if
they continued to nest down there...
It could have been a disaster!";
"38c03";"I can't believe Gila had demons lurking
in his basement. It's like something out
of a child's nightmare!";
"38c73";"You've done a great service not just for
Gila, but for us all. Thank you, Adol!";
"38cc9";"Demons in Gila's basement...
How terrifying to think about!";
"38d0b";"...So you plan to exterminate them,
then? Just be careful, Adol... I don't
want to lose you!";
"38d6f";"Well, that might explain what everyone's
been hearing during the night. Demon
voices, perhaps?";
"38dd5";"Are you saying...that Gila's monsters
are real?!";
"38e0d";"But if that's true...then I must say,
I don't like having it within Lance
one bit. Be very careful with it, Adol!";
"38e85";"Legend has it that demons are drawn to
its sound.";
"38ebd";"It looks like the #c2#Evil Bell#c# that the
Priests used long ago, to lead demons
out of villages...";
"38f29";"...I must ask you, though... What in the
world is that ghastly bell you've got?!";
"38f81";"With such horrible things happening
around every corner, your visit is
like a ray of sunshine for us, Adol!";
"38ff3";"And many people have been hearing
demonic voices coming from beneath
the ground, late at night...";
"3905b";"The elder saw two beautiful girls in
the Ruins, and he said they looked
just like the Goddesses...";
"390c5";"Some strange things started happening
not long before you arrived here.";
39113;"The area around Lance Village has
become so treacherous, one can
scarcely go for a walk anymore!";
"3917b";"This was once a peaceful village...
until the demons started showing up
in the abandoned Rasteenie Mine.";
"391eb";"Lately, I've been listless and slug-
gish...but now, it's like I've caught
a second wind. It's wonderful!";
"3925b";"I feel as if I could run a marathon,
in fact!";
"3928f";"I'm all better now, thanks to you.";
"392b9";"...That worries me. I...don't want you
to get hurt, Adol...";
"392fb";"And...";
39309;"I know that what you're doing will alter
the course of destiny. Not just Lance,
but all of Ys hangs in the balance.";
39383;"...I want to be able to help you, Adol.";
"393b1";"I...";
"393bd";"I don't know why...but I want to help
you. More than I've ever wanted to do
anything else in my entire life.";
39431;"I feel like I should be doing something,
too...";
39467;"But...";
39475;"So I don't wish to cause her any
unnecessary concern.";
"394b1";"I'm really all my mother has.";
"394d5";"I'm sure it was harder for her, though,
to know what was going on and have no
way of helping...";
"3953b";"And I thought SHE didn't know, so I was
doing the same...";
"3957b";"She knew of my illness, but was keeping
it secret, for my sake. She thought I
didn't know.";
"395dd";"My father died when I was just a baby,
so my mother had to raise me all by
herself.";

my mother sad...and make me feel guilty.";

All right. I
understand.";
"3cccd";"Hmm...?";
"3ccdb";"#c2#Adol explained the manner in which
he had been cursed.";
"3cd1d";"Finding the room is the first
step toward recovering your
true form.";
"3cd69";"The Sacred Cup is said to be somewhere
in the Shrine...in a #c2#room with walls of
a color distinct from its surroundings#c#.";
"3cded";"If you fill it with a certain kind of
water, it becomes blessed...and the
resulting holy water can nullify curses.";
"3ce67";"It seems the Priest #c2#Dabbie#c# is said
to have possessed a magical artifact
known as the '#c2#Sacred Cup#c#.'";
"3cedf";"First order of business is to get you
turned human again. Which shouldn't
be too difficult...";
"3cf43";"Mmm, mmm... I see.
Quite a powerful
wizard, then!";
"3cf7b";"Now, we'll be able to go anywhere
we wish. Perhaps this is how things
were meant to be...";
"3cfdb";"Ys...upon the world's surface
once more? Amazing...";
"3d015";"You found it in the Shrine,
you say? Amazing! Quite a
find, indeed!";
"3d05f";"This is unprecedented... How
did you come to possess this?!";
"3d0a1";"Oh, my... That's the #c2#Silver Pendant#c#!
Legend has it that that pendant was
once worn by one of the Goddesses.";
"3d11b";"I believe its power should still be
effective. You can use that pendant
to reach the holy palace itself!";
"3d18b";"It looks like it's made of
the sacred metal, Cleria.";
"3d1c7";"That pendant is said to be a pass,
of sorts, granting access to the
#c2#Goddesses' Palace#c#.";
"3d22b";"I almost feel like a new man.";
"3d24f";"I think that your visits were just
what I needed. You've given me a
reason to live again!";
"3d2af";"It's so peculiar...";
"3d2c9";"...Though that Dark Roo form
certainly wasn't without its
charms...";
"3d313";"Ahh, you're a sight for
sore eyes, m'boy!";
"3d343";"It has various restorative effects,
and one sip should relieve any and
all sense of fatigue.";
"3d3a7";"The physical properties down there
give it a flavor and consistency not
unlike that of wine.";
"3d40b";"Some of the well's water comes from
beneath the Moat of Burnedbless...";
"3d459";"No doubt about it...
It's a blessed spring!";
"3d48b";"From what I've been able to learn in my
research, this well has supplied water
of consistent freshness for 700 years.";
"3d507";"It's been here since
well before this house
was built.";
"3d545";"The well here is more than just
an ordinary water source...";
"3d587";"I've lost everything I care about...";
"3d5b3";"I never once imagined that the place
I love could become a haven for demons,
and a source for great malice...";
"3d627";"All my life, I've been fascinated with
Solomon Shrine. My purpose in life is to
study artifacts from within its walls.";
"3d6a5";"If they should take me...
I'd be almost grateful!";
"3d6dd";"I'm just an old man... My time
in this world is just about up,
demons or no.";
"3d731";"A properly maintained suit of armor is
an absolute must against the demons.
Make sure you take care of yours.";
"3d7a5";"Welcome. I sell swords, shields and
armor here.";
"3d7db";"You should make certain you're well
prepared before leaving the confines
of the village.";
"3d83b";"Going outside with no weapons or armor
would be suicide.";
"3d87b";"There are demons all over out there.";
"3d8a7";"Welcome. I sell swords, shields and
armor here. My stock is a bit low right
now, but do feel free to look around.";
"3d91f";"I bet Lazlo could really use some of
that iron for smithing. What do you say?
Would you sell it to me?";
"3d98d";"Hey, now, is that the unmistakable
glint of #c2#Iron Ore#c# I see, or do my
eyes deceive me?";
"3d9f1";"Welcome. I have some fine swords,
armor and shields for sale.";
"3da35";"It's been ages since I've gotten my
hands on Iron Ore. I've had to double
my prices just to get by!";
"3da9f";"I bet Lazlo could really use some of
that iron for smithing. What do you say?
Would you sell it to me?";
"3db0d";"Haven't seen iron around here in a long,
long time.";
"3db47";"Hey, now, is that the unmistakable
glint of Iron Ore I see, or do my
eyes deceive me?";
"3dba3";"If I had some #c2#Iron Ore#c#, I'm sure I'd
be able to stock better weapons and
armor, but...I stand by what I have.";

sit with you?";
"3decd";"No";
"3ded7";"Yes";
"3dedf";"How's #c2#6000 Gold#c#

"3df0b";"No";
"3df15";"Yes";
"3df1d";"How's #c2#3000 Gold#c#
sit with you?";
"3df49";"Thanks.";
"3df57";"Thanks. This is just what we need to
make some quality merchandise.";
"3dfa1";"Iron Ore is the lifeblood of our
business. If you should change your
mind, be sure you let me know.";
"3e00b";"Not selling? That's a real shame...";
"3e035";"Well, Iron Ore is a pretty valuable
commodity, after all. If you should
change your mind, please let me know.";
"3e0a9";"Not selling? That's a real shame...";
"3e0d3";"Leave";
"3e0df";"Buy armor";
"3e0ef";"Buy shield";
"3e101";"Buy sword";
"3e111";"Speak to Guido";
"3e125";"Have a look around!";
"3e13f";"I may not have anything new, but have a
look around. It's always an honor to
sell to an upstanding man like yourself.";
"3e1bb";"You're my most valued customer, you
know. No joke!";
"3e1f5";"That's one fine suit of armor you've got
there.";
"3e22b";"Damned beasts'll have to think twice
before they come knocking, if they know
what's good for 'em!";
"3e293";"Thanks to that Iron Ore, I've been able
to get the villagers better outfitted
for protection from demon attacks.";
"3e30b";"Be sure to come back and buy yourself a
suit when it's done!";
"3e34f";"It won't be long now until I've got some
really solid armor lined up for you.";
"3e3a3";"That ore you sold me was a real
lifesaver.";
"3e3d5";"If you come across any Iron Ore, I'll
buy it from you for 6000 Gold. More than
I can afford, but what choice do I have?";
"3e453";"And with all the demons running around,
we could really use new equipment, you
know?";
"3e4af";"We're out of #c2#Iron Ore#c#, so we can't make
any new armor.";
"3e4f3";"If I just had some iron ore, I'd be able
to hand it over and get some really
high-quality armor made.";
"3e55f";"Lazlo's an excellent armorsmith, but he
isn't really able to do much with his
skills these days.";
"3e5c7";"...But, that's why we don't have any
really good armor here.";
"3e60b";"Can't say I blame him. I wouldn't want
to risk my life down there, either!";
"3e65d";"A friend of mine is a miner, so I asked
him about it, but he said there's no way
he's going down there.";
"3e6cb";"It's just too risky to look for ore
while Rasteenie is swarming with demons.";
"3e71f";"I really wish I had a better selection
for you, but we just don't have the
materials we need.";
"3e783";"Always remember, though, to keep what
you need and what you can afford in
balance. It's an important decision!";
"3e7f9";"We have some fine swords here.";
"3e81f";"Nothing";
"3e82d";"Talwar";
"3e83b";"Long Sword";
"3e84d";"Short Sword";
"3e85d";"So, what'll it be?";
"3e877";"We have some fine armor available. It
doesn't come cheap, though.";
"3e8bf";"You'll have to settle for our normal
stock, until it's done.";
"3e903";"Sorry... The new armor isn't ready
just yet.";
"3e937";"This is all we have in stock.";
"3e95b";"Sorry... We just don't have the
materials.";
"3e98d";"Nothing";
"3e99b";"Plate Mail";
"3e9ad";"Breast Plate";
"3e9c1";"Chain Mail";
"3e9d1";"So, what'll it be?";
"3e9eb";"Nothing";
"3e9f9";"Chain Mail";
"3ea09";"So, what'll it be?";
"3ea23";"Nothing";
"3ea31";"Chain Mail";
"3ea41";"So, what'll it be?";
"3ea5b";"Anyway, have a look around. Surround
yourself in the opulence of my stock,
and imagine, would if they were yours...";
"3ead5";"People tend to think of shields as less
important than armor, but you'd be
surprised how useful they are.";
"3eb45";"Nothing";
"3eb53";"Large Shield";
"3eb67";"Small Shield";
"3eb7b";"Wooden Shield";
"3eb8d";"So, what'll it be?";
"3eba7";"#c2#200 Gold#c# should cover you.";
"3ebcf";"I wouldn't put too much faith in it if
you're going to be fighting demons, but
it's certainly better than nothing!";
"3ec49";"It's pretty small and easy to handle.";
"3ec75";"Don't buy";
"3ec85";"Buy";
"3ec8d";"You want it?";
"3eca1";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3ed07";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3ed33";"I'll let it go for a cool #c2#1000 Gold#c#.";
"3ed65";"This is definitely what you want if
you're planning to do some serious
fighting with the demons!";
"3edcd";"It's a little on the heavy side, with a
long blade.";
"3ee07";"Don't buy";
"3ee17";"Buy";
"3ee1f";"You want it?";
"3ee33";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3ee99";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3eec5";"It's #c2#5000 Gold#c#, and not a GP less.";
"3eef5";"It takes a fair degree of skill to use
it, but you seem to know what you're
doing. You'll pick up on it in no time!";
"3ef6f";"Now, is this not a work of art? This
curved blade has an exceptionally fine
cutting edge.";
"3efcf";"Don't buy";
"3efdf";"Buy";
"3efe7";"You want it?";
"3effb";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f061";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f08d";"It's also only #c2#500 Gold#c#, though!";
"3f0bb";"It's light and easy to move around in,
but doesn't offer that much in the way
of defense.";
"3f11b";"It's a suit of woven chain mail. It'll
deflect sword strikes and offer marginal
protection against mortal wounds.";
"3f193";"Don't buy";
"3f1a3";"Buy";
"3f1ab";"You want it?";
"3f1bf";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f225";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f251";"I'll take #c2#2000 Gold#c# for it.";
"3f27b";"It's heavier than the Chain Mail, but
offers much better defense.";
"3f2c3";"This armor is designed to protect the
chest with iron plating.";
"3f309";"Don't buy";
"3f319";"Buy";
"3f321";"You want it?";
"3f335";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f39b";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f3c7";"It's been appraised at #c2#8000 Gold#c#. By me.";
"3f3fd";"It offers full-body protection, so
you'll have nothing to fear from those
demons at all!";
"3f45d";"This is the finest armor available, made
of specially-molded metal plates.";
"3f4af";"Don't buy";
"3f4bf";"Buy";
"3f4c7";"You want it?";
"3f4db";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f541";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f56d";"...Probably fine to start with, though.
But you should definitely upgrade as
soon as you can. How's #c2#100 Gold#c# sound?";
"3f5ef";"It's a hard wooden shield. It's light
and easy to handle, but I wouldn't
suggest going up against demons with it.";
"3f667";"Don't buy";
"3f677";"Buy";
"3f67f";"You want it?";
"3f693";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f6f9";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f725";"If you have the skill to use it, it
should suit your needs well. I think
#c2#1500 Gold#c# is a fair asking price.";
"3f79d";"It's not too big, as shields go...but
it's strong and easy to handle.";
"3f7e9";"Don't buy";
"3f7f9";"Buy";
"3f801";"You want it?";
"3f815";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f87b";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3f8a7";"It's just that good! Which is why I'm
asking #c2#6000 Gold#c# for it.";
"3f8f3";"If you're skilled enough to use the
Large Shield, you should make short
work of the demons around here.";
"3f961";"Don't buy";
"3f971";"Buy";
"3f979";"You want it?";
"3f98d";"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";
"3f9f3";"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";
"3fa1f";"But you don't seem vicious, so...I guess
I can let you go. THIS time.";
"3fa6b";"You've got some nerve to just...waltz
into an armory like that!";
"3fab1";"Please go to the counter if you want to
buy something.";
"3faef";"But you don't seem vicious, so...I guess
I can let you go. THIS time.";
"3fb3b";"You've got some nerve to just...waltz
into an armory like that!";
"3fb81";"Thanks for your business. Come again
soon!";
"3fbb3";"One bite of me and you're a dead little
fuzzy-wuzzy.";
"3fbef";"I've got special armor on.";
"3fc11";"Thanks to you, Guido's fully restocked.
Take a look around! Bask in the glow
of my quality smithing!";
"3fc7d";"Heh, what do you think? Nice work on the
Breast Plate and Plate Mail, no?";
"3fccd";"Give me just a little time, and I'll be
ready to show you my newest creations!";
"3fd23";"Thanks to you, I'll have no trouble
crafting all kinds of quality armor.";
"3fd73";"Well, if it isn't the guy who sold us
the Iron Ore!";
"3fdad";"Well, I'm just afraid I'm going to lose
my touch. I mean, it's been so long
since I last worked metal!";
"3fe1b";"I'm at an utter loss here... If we only
had some Iron Ore, we could get some
work done, but as it is...";
"3fe89";"...I won't actually do that, of course,
but the thought HAS crossed my mind.
That's how desperately I want some ore!";
"3ff05";"I might as well try my luck at going
down into the mines myself...";
"3ff4f";"For someone like me, not being able to
work is like not being able to breathe.";
"3ffa5";"Ahh, it's no use... Without Iron Ore,
there's just nothing for me to do!";
"3fff5";"You've got some real promise. Thanks
very much for what you've done on behalf
of us all.";
40055;"Dr. Flair's made it back safe...and I
hear you're the one who rescued him.";
"400a7";"Please, take this with you. Consider it
a token of my gratitude.";
"400ef";"Oh, don't worry about it. I owe Dr.
Flair a favor or two, myself.";
40137;"Now, if I could just get ahold of some
Iron Ore, this torture would be over and
done with!";
40199;"What's that? Dr. Flair had an accident
in Rasteenie?!";
"401d5";"...So I can't help thinking I'm
at least partially responsible for
putting him in danger...";
40237;"You know, I asked him to keep an
eye out for any Iron Ore...";
"4027b";"Can't make anything else
without iron ore.";
"402ad";"Sorry, but Chain Mail is all I've got
right now.";
"402e5";"Are you looking to buy some armor?";
"4030f";"So how are your travels going? You may
be young and resilient, but you should
still take it easy from time to time.";
40389;"Hey there, Adol.";
"403a1";"No one's found Lilia yet, but I have
faith that she's all right.";
"403e9";"So how are your travels going? You may
be young and resilient, but you should
still take it easy from time to time.";
40463;"Hey there, Adol.";
"4047b";"Everyone's worried about her. We have no
idea where she could be...";
"404c5";"You may have heard, but Lilia's gone
missing.";
"404f9";"Hey there, Adol.";
40511;"Helping people makes you feel really
good, doesn't it? I'm so glad to hear
that Lilia's okay!";
40575;"Oh, my... What's wrong?";
40593;"I never even considered the possibility
of a cave-in. Seems the most obvious
concern in the world, though, now...";
"4060b";"I know the layout of the abandoned mine
quite well, but as a result, I got cocky
and assumed I was ready for anything.";
40689;"Hey there, Adol. Thank you for coming to
my rescue back there.";
"406cf";"Oh, Adol! The man who bravely swooped
in and saved the day when the ceiling
came tumbling down on our doctor, no?";
40747;"...Oh, is that letter for me?";
"4076b";"Either way, you cleared a path through
the cave-in, and as a result, I'm able
to stand here now. You're a lifesaver!";
"407e7";"Tell me, did you came down into the
mines to rescue me, or was rescuing me
simply a case of dumb luck?";
40855;"Oh, my... Adol, is it?";
40873;"Adol, would you please look for a Roda
Fruit and Celceta Flower in my place?
For Lilia's sake?";
"408d9";"I'm sure I could find one in Rasteenie
Mine, but that place is filled with
demons. I'd never make it out alive!";
"4094f";"And the Celceta Flower only grows in
dark areas, close to bodies of water.";
"409a1";"We used to be able to find Roda
Fruits out in the ruins.";
"409e1";"I'm going to need a Roda Fruit
and a Celceta Flower in order
to save her.";
"40a31";"...This is terrible! Lilia has fallen
ill?!";
"40a63";"I'll do everything in my power to save
her, and I'm hoping you'll do the same.
I'm counting on you, swordsman!";
"40ad9";"I'm pretty sure you've already figured
this out, but Lilia is really a very
sweet, kindly girl.";
"40b3f";"Doctor! He's got a Roda Fruit and
a Celceta Flower!";
"40b79";"...Amazing!";
"40b8b";"Hmm? Wait just a moment, Adol. That
green fruit, and that blue flower...
Are they what I think they are?!";
"40bfb";"We'll begin mixing the cure right away.
Please wait just a bit, would you?";
"40c4d";"You made it in plenty of time, too.
She'll be just fine, I'm sure of it!";
"40c9d";"...By the Goddesses, it's true! Adol,
you've done it! You've saved Lilia's
life!";
"40cf5";"What?! Tell me you're not just pulling
an old man's leg, my friend!";
"40d3f";"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";
"40d67";"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";
"40d9f";"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";
"40e15";"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";
"40e8b";"Thank you for agreeing to help, Adol.
Please, do your best to find Dr. Flair!";

just fine. I'm sure of it. She may not
seem it, but she's a strong one!";

gift for you than just herbs...but I
think she's already given you her heart.";

you...so I'm sure she's not far off.
And she's probably okay.";

seem to be doing well. I almost didn't
recognize you! You're quite the fighter.";

without seeing the patient...and curses
aren't really my area of expertise...";

"417d9";"You're looking for a medicine to cure
someone who's been turned to stone, you
say?!";
41833;"What's that you say?";
"4184f";"If it were a disease, then sure, I could
do something about it...but a curse?
Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.";
"418cb";"I sure hope she's okay out there...";
"418f5";"I swear, that girl... She's just started
feeling better, and here she goes off
into the demon-infested wilderness!";
"4196f";"Lilia left the village a while ago, and
has yet to return.";
"419b1";"What EVER will you do...?";
"419d1";"And a sense of gratitude like that can
easily develop into feelings of love...";
"41a27";"She owes you her life, Adol.";
"41a4b";"Praise the Goddesses that Lilia has been
cured!";
"41a81";"Splendid! Absolutely splendid!";
"41aa7";"So Lilia's been cured?";
"41ac5";"If we could get the ingredients we need,
I'd be able to prepare medicine for her.";
"41b1d";"She's never done anything to deserve
this...";
"41b51";"Lilia is such a sweet young girl.";
"41b79";"I'll say this about you, Adol: You've
got courage well beyond your years.
Please, rescue Dr. Flair, won't you?";
"41bef";"Have you found the doctor yet? ...Still
trapped, is he? I see... Well, at least
we know he's uninjured.";
"41c5d";"You'll need the elder's permission to
enter, too, so be sure to pay him a
visit before you leave.";
"41cc5";"#c2#Rasteenie Mine#c# is a dangerous place,
so don't push your luck. If you get
hurt, turn back!";
"41d2d";"I beg you, Adol. Anything you can do to
save Dr. Flair would be a blessing...";
"41d81";"Dr. Flair isn't in at the moment, so try
not to get yourself too banged up, okay?";
"41dd9";"What's wrong, Adol?";
"41df3";"Honestly, Adol... There's nothing wrong
with you, I promise!";
"41e37";"...";
"41e41";"Well, if you're really insistent on
being seen right away, I can pull a
few strings. But there WILL be a fee!";
"41eb5";"Though I do understand not wanting to
impose, of course.";
"41ef5";"You can rest at Banoa's house, too,
right? Wounds need time to heal, after
all. A rest would do you good!";
"41f65";"If you stop and rest in the village,
your wounds will gradually heal over
time. Good to keep this in mind!";
"41fd7";"No";
"41fe1";"Yes";
"41fe9";"The bill for treatment
is #c2#20 Gold#c#, okay?";
"4201f";"All right. As you wish, then.";
42043;"You want an Herb? That'll be #c2#30 Gold#c#.";
42077;"#c0#Don't buy";
"4208b";"#c0#Buy";
42097;"Sound good?";
"420a9";"Quickly, take #c2#Lilia's Medicine#c# to her,
right away!";
"420e9";"That flower made it possible to save
Lilia's life...and it's all thanks to
you!";
"4213f";"It won't be long now...";
"4215d";"Excellent work! If I mix this with a
#c2#Roda Fruit#c#, that'll be all we need to
cure Lilia for good!";
"421cb";"The blue Celceta is actually quite
pretty, but it only grows in dark areas,
near water. I bet the mine's got a few.";
42245;"Unfortunately, as the climate changed,
the hillside variety died off. But there
should still be blue Celcetas out there!";
"422c5";"According to legend, the white hillside
variety represents love, while the blue
nocturnal variety represents life.";
"4233f";"Long ago, there were two different
varieties of Celceta Flower.";
42385;"Yeah, it's no easy task. Keep at it,
though!";
"423b9";"So, have you found a #c2#Celceta Flower#c# yet?";
"423ef";"The Roda Fruit was allegedly picked from
those trees, originally. That's why it's
so rare.";
42451;"Supposedly, there were also twin trees
that served the Goddesses. Everything
Ys comes in twos, it seems!";
"424c1";"Once, the land of Ys was watched over by
twin Goddesses, who represented the twin
moons that circle this world.";
42537;"You actually found a Roda Fruit?!";
"4255f";"Wow, really?!";
42573;"You know, Adol, seeing how hard you work
makes me think that you must channel the
strength of the Goddesses themselves.";
"425f1";"If that's true, then you might still be
able to find some there.";
42639;"I've heard that people used to pick them
in the #c2#Ruins of Moondoria#c#.";
"4268b";"The Roda Fruit calms the mind and
soothes the heart. It's almost like
it restores a person's will to live.";
"426fd";"But Lilia absolutely needs this
medicine. Without it, she simply
can't survive.";
42753;"One is a #c2#Celceta Flower#c#, and the other
is a #c2#Roda Fruit#c#. And unfortunately,
neither is easy to come by these days.";
"427d9";"In order to cure Lilia, we'll need two
ingredients.";
42813;"Something's been whipping the demons
outside the village into a frenzy
lately. So watch yourself out there!";
42885;"We'll do what we can for Lilia.
I know you will, too.";
"428c1";"Dr. Flair's having enough trouble with
expenses as it is. I mean, we're trying
to make a living here! I'm very sorry.";
"4293d";"Um, Adol... I don't mean to sound
callous, but I can't treat you if
you won't pay the fee.";
"4299f";"Hahaha... Sorry about that.";
"429c1";"Let's get you all patched up!";
"429e5";"There, all better. Try to be a bit more
careful, though, okay? It's like you're
running right into the demons, head on!";
"42a63";"Herbs are a valuable commodity these
days. If you already have one, I can't
in all good conscience sell you another.";
"42adf";"Don't you think you have enough?";
"42b07";"The nurse tends to come off a bit harsh,
no? She needs to work on that bedside
manner of hers!";
"42b6d";"Dr. Flair's having enough trouble with
expenses as it is. I mean, we're trying
to make a living here! I'm very sorry.";
"42be9";"I don't mean to seem callous, but I
can't just waive the bill. This IS a
business, after all!";
"42c4d";"I'm afraid you don't have enough money,
Adol.";
"42c81";"Oh-ho-ho... My apologies, my apologies!";
"42caf";"We'll begin mixing the cure right away.
Please wait just a bit, would you?";
"42d01";"You made it in plenty of time, too.
She'll be just fine, I'm sure of it!";
"42d51";"You did it, Adol! With the Celceta and
the Roda Fruit, I can finally mix the
medicine Lilia so desperately needs!";
"42dc9";"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";
"42df1";"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";
"42e29";"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";
"42e9f";"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";
"42f15";"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";
"42f3d";"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";
"42f75";"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";
"42feb";"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";
43065;"Anyway, that should do it.
Have a nice day, little guy!";
"430a7";"You can't subsist on nuts and
berries alone. You need to get
some protein in your diet, too!";
"4310f";"Tsk, tsk... You really should think
more about nutrition. You're clearly
not eating very well!";
43179;"Hold still, now...";
43197;"Since you're here, I might
as well give you a checkup.";
"431d9";"But you're certainly no demon...
You're just a little cutie! Who's a
little cutie? You are! Yes you are!";
"4324d";"Ah, it's a Roo. Lost your way, little
fellow? You had me thinking the demons
had come attacking!";
"432b9";"Hmm?";
"432c9";"Just to clarify, you DO need more
protein, but humans are NOT a good
source for that. Just...so you know.";
43339;"Take care out there!";
43355;"I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and love
you forever and ever and ever!";
"433a3";"Ohhhh, you're SOOOOOOO CUTE!";
"433c7";"Take care!";
"433d9";"...Will you accept my devotion?";
"433ff";"In...in place of my life...";
43421;"Yikes!";
"4342f";"Oh, you found my brother? He's
safe? That's wonderful news!";
43471;"I'm so relieved just knowing
that he's okay.";
"434a5";"You're heading off to rescue him
now, are you? Well, good luck!";
"434eb";"Please, Adol! Will you
go and help my brother?";
43521;"#c0#No";
"4352f";"#c0#Yes";
"4353b";"#c1#Agree to help?";
43555;"Please, Adol, bring my brother
back safely from the ruins!";
43597;"I'm so worried...";
"435af";"Thank you!";
"435c1";"All right! Go, Banoa! With two of us
pressuring you to find him, you really
have no choice but to give in!";
43633;"What's that? Banoa asked you
to deliver a letter to my
brother?";
43679;"I don't have much to give, but please,
use this to buy some new equipment.";
"436cb";"We're counting on you, Adol.
Show us what you're made of!";
"4370b";"He won't let you in without the elder's
permission. So you may wish to drop by
the elder's house before you go.";
43781;"You'll find Astal guarding
the entrance to the Ruins.";
"437bd";"Oh, and Adol... Just so you know...";
"437e7";"Please, Adol, I beg of you! Don't leave
us out to dry like this! We NEED you!";
"4383b";"You...won't help? But...you're the
hero! Isn't it your solemn duty?!";
43887;"Oh...th-this is terrible! Just awful!";
"438b3";"What's with all the
shouting, Leonor?";
"438df";"It's a carrier pigeon that just arrived,
with a note from Dr. Flair...";
"4392d";"It's...";
"4393f";"#c0#'There was a cave-in at the
Rasteenie Mine. The rocks have
blocked the passage, and I'm
trapped. I can only pray this
bird makes it back with my
letter. If you're reading this,
please send help!'";
"43a0d";"This is terrible! You mean to
tell me that Dr. Flair is trapped
in the abandoned Rasteenie Mine?!";
"43a75";"So it would seem. I don't
know what to do...";
"43aa9";"There's nothing I
can do to help...
I'm powerless!";
"43ae3";"I'd be completely lost down in that
mine, and the demons would overpower
me in a second!";
"43b43";"...Wait! We have a swordsman
among us!";
"43b71";"Please, I beg of you! Rescue
my brother! We need him here,
now more than ever!";
"43bc7";"Adol, won't you please go to
Dr. Flair's aid?!";
"43bfd";"Yes, Adol, please! It would mean a
great deal to me, as well!";
"43c41";"#c0#No";
"43c4f";"#c0#Yes";
"43c5b";"#c1#Agree to help?";
"43c75";"Leave";
"43c81";"Buy items";
"43c91";"Talk to Jade";
"43ca3";"What would you like?";
"43cbf";"I'll make sure I set one of everything
aside for you, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";
"43d37";"I'll make sure I set one of everything
aside for you, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";
"43daf";"My offer stands, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";
"43e01";"I must say, I'm utterly stunned...
I never imagined something so sig-
nificant would happen in my lifetime.";
"43e73";"I just heard... Is it true? Has Ys
really fallen back to the surface?";
"43ebf";"Of course, she's run off somewhere at
this point. And honestly, I am a bit
concerned about that!";
"43f27";"...There is one girl, isn't there?";
"43f51";"Is there anyone special in your life,
Adol?";
"43f83";"...Oh, yeah, do you know Kate? She's
the woman outside who won't shut her
trap, no matter what.";
"43fe9";"Now, if it were my wife out there,
it's the DEMONS I'd be worried about.
She'd give 'em one hell of a talking to!";
44061;"Don't you feel the same way? It's
as if she's being watched over by
a guardian angel...";
"440bf";"I'm not sure why, really, but I do.";
"440e9";"Events of late have been simply
dreadful. Yet...somehow, I believe
Lilia will be all right.";
"4414b";"It's good to hear she's doing better,
though.";
"4417f";"You never would have known,
to look at her.";
"441b1";"I heard that Banoa's daughter, Lilia,
got herself sick. I had no idea!";
"441ff";"There just seem to be more and more
demons with every passing week. It's...
peculiar, is what it is!";
"4426b";"How do things look outside these days?";
44299;"It's made a dent in our profits, but
Flair's much better at meeting demand
than I ever was.";
"442fb";"I don't mind, though. Really, it's more
convenient this way.";
"4433f";"I used to keep Herbs in stock, but there
hasn't been much point since Flair built
his clinic.";
"443a3";"The rest... Well, you might find
something to buy. Depends on what
you need, I suppose.";
44401;"No real must-buys, but the Wing is a
pretty indispensable tool for travelers.
Best not to leave town without one!";
44479;"Can't say I've got the best stock in
the world or anything, but then...who
does, in these trying times?";
"444e7";"Quit";
"444f3";"Elixir";
44501;"Marle Flower";
44515;"Apple";
44521;"Wing";
"4452b";"What would you like
to buy?";

44559;"Iron Ore";
44569;"Roda Fruit";
"4457b";"Marle Flower";
"4458d";"What'll it be?";
"445a3";"Thank you.";
"445b5";"It's #c2#100 Gold#c#. How about it?";
"445df";"Use it, rest up, then get right back
out in the fray!";
"4461b";"If you're ever lost in an area full of
demons, you'll be glad to have one of
these on hand.";
"4467d";"It's basically designed to make narrow
escapes from tight situations.";
"446c9";"This is a magic item that'll instantly
teleport you back to any town you've
previously visited.";
"4472f";"Don't buy";
"4473f";"Buy";
44747;"Do you want it?";
"4475d";"You can come back and buy another after
you've used the one you have.";
"447a9";"You already have a Wing, it seems.
Why not save this for someone who
needs it more?";
44803;"Not to say profits are foremost on my
mind or anything, but I do have to make
a living. I hope you can understand.";
"4487d";"Thank you very mu-- Wait. Sir, I'm
afraid you don't have enough money!";
"448cb";"Oh, you're buying one?";
"448e9";"All I'm asking for it is #c2#10 Gold#c#.
Not a bad price, you know!";
44933;"It'll pep you up if you're feeling
hungry, and it's also a great gift
for the ladies. What do you say?";
"449a1";"It's an apple, at the peak of ripeness.
Looks delicious, doesn't it?";
"449ed";"Don't buy";
"449fd";"Buy";
"44a05";"Do you want it?";
"44a1b";"I appreciate your business, sir, but you
can't carry any more apples.";
"44a67";"Not to say profits are foremost on my
mind or anything, but I do have to make
a living. I hope you can understand.";
"44ae1";"Thank you very mu-- Wait. Sir, I'm
afraid you don't have enough money!";
"44b2f";"Oh, you're buying one?";
"44b4d";"It's a bargain at #c2#10 Gold#c#.
What do you say?";
"44b87";"I'm betting anyone would love for you
to give them one!";
"44bc5";"It has no medicinal effect, but flowers
have a certain magic about them all
their own. They make great gifts.";
"44c39";"To be honest, it's just an ordinary
flower...dug up out in the field and
raised from a sprout.";
"44c9f";"Don't buy";
"44caf";"Buy";
"44cb7";"Do you want it?";
"44ccd";"You've already got a few specimens, it
seems. I don't think you should hog
them all!";
"44d29";"Not to say profits are foremost on my
mind or anything, but I do have to make
a living. I hope you can understand.";
"44da3";"Thank you very mu-- Wait. Sir, I'm
afraid you don't have enough money!";
"44df1";"Oh, you're buying one?";
"44e0f";"It was truly the pride and joy of my
shop. In a way, I actually have a bit
of seller's remorse. I wish I'd kept it!";
"44e89";"Have you forgotten? You already bought
the only one I had.";
"44ecb";"#c2#60,000 Gold#c# is what I'm asking.";
"44ef9";"If I had to, I suppose I could sell it,
though I've priced it well out of the
range of most sane individuals.";
"44f6d";"Quite the miracle drug, it is... It'll
bring you back to life after suffering
a mortal wound.";
"44fd1";"In fact, it's the only one of its kind
in all the world. I'm legitimately
proud to own it!";
45033;"I put it out more for bragging rights
than to actually sell it.";
45079;"I know I said before that I had no real
must-buys here...but that's because this
little vial is priceless to me!";
"450f1";"Ah, you have a keen eye, sir. This is
something of true worth. I'd even go
so far as to call it my pride and joy!";
45169;"Don't buy";
45179;"Buy";
45181;"Can you handle that?";
"4519d";"Such a crazy price...";
"451b9";"See? You're sane, so it's out of your
price range. The system works!";
45205;"It pains me to sell it, but I'm
impressed by your dedication.
Use it well, young man!";
45261;"You must really have been saving up!";
"4528d";"I...I can't believe it. You actually
bought it!";
"452c3";"How can you sell me something you don't
have? Mind games don't work on me!";
45315;"If you please, sir.";
"4532f";"A Marle Flower, eh? Well, the blossom is
in good shape, and the root's intact.
I'll give you #c2#5 Gold#c# for it.";
"453a9";"Don't sell";
"453bb";"Sell";
"453c5";"Will you sell it?";
"453dd";"Pleasure doing business with you!";
45405;"How can you sell me something you don't
have? Mind games don't work on me!";
45457;"If you please, sir.";
45471;"Well, well, it's a Roda Fruit. Where in
Ys did you find it? I'll give you #c2#25 Gold#c#
for it.";
"454d9";"Don't sell";
"454eb";"Sell";
"454f5";"Will you sell it?";
"4550d";"Pleasure doing business with you!";
45535;"How can you sell me something you don't
have? Mind games don't work on me!";
45587;"If you please, sir.";
"455a1";"Iron Ore? This should prove quite
useful! I'll give you #c2#1500 Gold#c#
for it.";
"455f9";"Don't sell";
"4560b";"Sell";
45615;"Will you sell it?";
"4562d";"Pleasure doing business with you!";
45655;"I-if you want to buy something,
p-please go to the other side
of the counter...o-okay?";
"456b3";"Oh, sir? I hate to make a fuss, but if
you want to buy something, please go to
the other side of the counter.";
45727;"It's like being in
a cage back here!";
45753;"...It can't get back HERE, right?";
"4577b";"Welcome!";
"4578b";"Come again!";
"4579d";"Leave";
"457a9";"Look at armor";
"457bd";"Look at shields";
"457d3";"Look at swords";
"457e9";"Talk to Zalem";
"457fb";"Don't be shy. Feel free
to look, touch, and even
try on for size!";
45843;"My inventory contains the best equipment
 known to man-- save for Cleria items,
anyway.";
"458a1";"No matter what you're faced with, this
equipment will see you through it.";
"458f1";"That light... It's...absolutely
remarkable...";
45925;"That armor...is made of pure Cleria...";
45953;"Please...may I touch it? I just want to
hold it in my hands! ...It's absolutely
stunning!";
"459b3";"Th-that sword and armor... Are they...
Cleria?!";
"459e9";"Well, I suppose I do have other stuff,
so take a good look around. See what you
can see...";
"45a4b";"I'm relieved, though. I was wondering
what I would do if another shop had
opened with equipment surpassing my own!";
"45ac5";"Hmmm... That's a bit worrisome, then. If
it was found, one must wonder how reli-
able it will be in the heat of battle...";
"45b45";"...Y-you FOUND it?!";
"45b5f";"You've acquired such great equipment...
You must be nearly invincible in it!
Where in the world did you buy it?!";
"45bd7";"I, for one, am glad those days are
behind me. Business has never been
better than it is now...";
"45c3d";"It wasn't that long ago that Ramia was a
much colder village, so I was forced to
wear thicker clothes than I do now.";
"45cb9";"Or do you just like my outfit?";
"45cdf";"Perhaps you only frequent my store
because you're interested in me, hmm?";
"45d2f";"Nice doing business with you. You've
just about bought out the store!";
"45d7b";"Well, I suppose I do have other stuff,
so take a good look around. See what you
can see...";
"45ddd";"Hey, you've got an Iron Shield. That's
a higher-quality item than anything I
have in stock.";
"45e3f";"But if you intend to fight the demons
around these parts, you'll need some
quality equipment to do the deed...";
"45eb5";"I kind of get the feeling that
you're a really great guy.";
"45ef5";"You're a young one, but you certainly do
seem to know your way around a sword.
You look ferocious...like a lion. Rawr!";
"45f73";"Ah, but how could I justify such a
transaction when you seem to have a
better sword than anything I sell?";
"45fe3";"Not that I mind when people browse.
Actually, I rather appreciate having
my wares examined...";

46055;"Hyper Cutter";
46069;"Talwar";
46077;"Long Sword";
46087;"What's your poison?";

here...";

Dabbie is an ancestor of mine. Who knew?";

did it!";
"47a8b";"And we have you to thank for that, Adol.
Words cannot express our gratitude. MY
gratitude...";

overcome the greatest disaster we've
ever faced.";
"47b4f";"...My apologies. I don't mean to bring
down the mood. This is no time for such
depressing talk!";

it more than anything. And she pitied
the demons for what they lacked...";

are, and all they know, is destruction.";

well of evil intent.";

Black Pearl in my demonic hand...I was
overcome with dark desires.";
"47d33";"But now that I've been a demon myself,
I think I understand.";
"47d77";"I was consumed by sorrow and rage at her
loss, so the idea of pity toward demons
seemed like nonsense.";
"47de5";"...At the time, I simply didn't
understand.";
"47e17";"And with her dying breath, she said
to me, 'I pity the demons.'";
"47e5d";"It was like her blood had stained the
sunset...and as the life slipped from
her body, she struggled to speak...";
"47ed3";"I remember what she said to me that
evening...six months ago, the day she
was taken from this mortal coil...";
"47f47";"...I remembered when my sister was
killed by the demons...";
"47f89";"When I was imprisoned in Burnedbless, I
lost myself in reverie.";
"47fcf";"Magic has vanished from the land, and
with it, so too has the curse placed
upon me.";
48029;"Adol. It's me, Keith. I am...no longer a
demon, so I apologize if my appearance
surprises you.";
"4808f";"We need your courage to help us rebuild
this ravaged land. We need you to keep
us on the right path.";
"480fb";"Please, stay with us here in Esteria.";
48127;"Adol, what you have accomplished here is
the true definition of heroism.";
48177;"You are the one who reclaimed that
right for us from the demons.";
"481bf";"Now we can begin rebuilding. We have
control over our lives once again.";
"4820d";"Without the shadow of the demons looming
over us, people can again stand on their
own two feet.";
48273;"Due to the finality of your victory, I
feel certain that Esteria will see many
changes soon. Positive changes...";
"482eb";"I was standing in front of Darm Tower,
and I saw its summit engulfed in light.
And then...you shot into the sky!";
48363;"Adol, you've really done it.";
48387;"You've brought peace back to Ys.
...Congratulations. You've truly
become a legend in your own time.";
"483f1";"Everyone owes you an amazing debt of
gratitude, Adol. Thank you.";
48439;"It really makes you think...";
"4845d";"And by relying so heavily on the power
of magic, we sowed the seeds of our own
undoing.";
"484bb";"It was made for our prosperity, and so
quickly became a part of our everyday
lives that ultimately, it controlled us.";
48537;"What an astounding power...";
48559;"So, Adol... The magic that spawned the
demons was the same magic that kept Ys
afloat, correct?";
"485bf";"I had to run like mad, and I just barely
made it here in time for that final
battle of yours.";
48623;"I woke up, and LOOKED up...and there it
was! The land of Ys, right in front of
my eyes!";
48681;"In it, the Goddesses appeared before me,
and told me that Ys was returning to the
surface, and I was to go to the Shrine.";
48701;"Like everybody else, I had a really odd
dream before coming here, myself.";
48751;"You did it, Adol!";
48769;"Dogi's really eager to see
you again, by the way!";
"487a1";"Maybe it did, and I somehow came back to
life...";
"487db";"When you were in the midst of the final
battle, I thought my heart was going to
explode.";
"4883d";"Adol! I'm so glad you're all right!";
48867;"If you have something to say, now's the
time, little lady.";
"488a9";"I, um... I... I...
...Goban, you're mean...";
"488db";"Um, Adol... Don't worry. I'm really
very happy to see you. Very...very...
happy...";
48935;"After seven hundred years of separation,
the peoples of Ys and Esteria-- and the
rest of the world-- can reunite as one.";
"489b5";"One by one, all will come to believe in
themselves in this new age.";
"489ff";"From this time forward, there will be
no need of Goddesses or Priests.";
"48a4d";"Many glorious days await. Far more now
than ever before.";
"48a8d";"We will never forget you or what you've
done for us, Adol. You have our eternal,
undying gratitude.";
"48af7";"We will watch over the land to make sure
this peace endures.";
"48b3b";"The two of us will see to it that the
magic brought about by the Black Pearl
will never be revived again.";
"48bab";"...I think we're third wheels here.
We should probably let ourselves out...";
"48bfd";"Adol, we're going to head back.";
"48c23";"Good thought, Maria.";
"48c3f";"...And now even the floating land of Ys
will be a thing of the past, as Esteria
becomes whole again.";
"48cab";"There's no real need for Goddesses or
Priests.";
"48ce1";"I never knew so many wonderful people
lived in this world.";
"48d23";"I feel like I understand everything now.";
"48d53";"After you rescued me from the depths of
the shrine, I stayed at Jeba's house for
a short while.";
"48db9";"There's so much I want to say. I don't
even know where to begin...";
"48e03";"I want you to know that, more than
anything else.";
"48e3b";"I have so many happy memories from my
time here...but the best will always be
the time I spent with you.";
"48eab";"During the time I spent with you,
I truly felt...human...";
"48eeb";"...I must go. Reah is waiting for me.";
"48f17";"I hope that you'll think of me from time
to time. And when you do, I hope you'll
remember me as a girl, not as a Goddess.";

you've made it to this lofty
height.";

49081;"In any event, those of Priestly descent
must be killed. Thus, our orders are to
cut down all who enter these halls.";

the Priests' descendants will be among
the sacrificial victims themselves!";

likely to come rushing in, brandishing
a righteous indignation.";

Priests' progeny are sickeningly heroic.";

descendants still reside in Ys today.";

it doesn't feel cold at all.";
"4b091";"...You crazy or something?!";
"4b0b3";"So what you're saying is that if you
clear your mind, even fire can feel
cool and refreshing?";
"4b117";"He doesn't have the shoes
for it. And they're not
easy to find...";
"4b15f";"Hee hee... Adol can't
climb the icy slopes.";
"4b191";"Do you know where that 'healing cloak'
or whatever it's called is hidden? I
know it's around here somewhere...";
"4b207";"Owwww, some red-haired
brat gave me a beating.";
"4b23d";"Stupid redhead. I'll use that cloak
to heal myself up, and then it's time
for some payback...medieval style!";
"4b2b1";"Lots of my friends have been
killed around here lately. You
should be real careful.";
"4b30b";"Don't you think that healing
cloak would suit me best?";
"4b349";"Doesn't do a thing to curb
your appetite, though.";
"4b381";"Y'know, snow's actually pretty tasty.";
"4b3ad";"...Ice? That's it? Sheesh.
I'm so tired of eating ice...";
"4b3ed";"Hey, you. Got anything to eat?";
"4b413";"But we're demons! What the
hell would WE need them for?!";
"4b453";"I've always thought that those shoes
might be useful for a human with weak
legs or something...";
"4b4b9";"So you should go find them
before a human does!";
"4b4ef";"With the Stone Shoes,
humans can gain great
traction on icy slopes.";
"4b539";"...What the heck is up
with that?!";
"4b563";"You know how when you eat something
cold really fast, you get a brain
freeze?";
"4b5b7";"All this walking around has made the
pretty white snow all dirty. That man
has a LOT of muck in his shoes!";
"4b629";"I hate that red-headed human.";
"4b64d";"Who are you?
You new to
this glacier?";
"4b679";"I wish I had fur. The guys who
do have it real lucky. They get
to stay warm!";
"4b6cd";"Flowers 're purty...";
"4b6e9";"I saw some pink flowers
growing around here.";
"4b71d";"Snow, snow everywhere,
and not a drop to drink!";
"4b753";"...An' I hink I caugh' a cold,
too... AAACHOO!";
"4b789";"Ooooh, I'bh cold...";
"4b7a3";"Didn't you live in this area once?
...Oh, that wasn't you? Must be
thinking of someone else...";
"4b809";"Hey, haven't I seen you
someplace before?";
"4b839";"Lots of my friends have been
killed around here lately...and
mostly by burning, no less!";
"4b899";"...I wish I'd've told her how
much she meant to me before
that happened...";
"4b8eb";"Many of my kind have been killed...
including my beloved daughter.";
"4b935";"...Tell me the truth, am I that ugly?";
"4b961";"They were so pretty that I walked
right up to them without thinking...
but when they saw me, they disappeared.";
"4b9d7";"There were these two girls
standing in front of the
Goddess statue yesterday.";
"4ba2b";"Probably a woman... Sure
sounded like one when she
screamed, at least.";
"4ba79";"I saw some human being
taken away by a flying
demon.";
"4bab5";"This area doesn't really have
any landmarks, so it's pretty
easy to lose your way.";
"4bb0f";"Many friends of mine been killed
lately. You be careful too, y'hear?";
"4bb5b";"I prefer my meat rare over well-done...
but I wouldn't say no to a nice medium-
well cut, either!";
"4bbc3";"Hahaha... I kill me!";
"4bbdf";"Why did the Roo cross the glacier?
...To get to the fire side!";
"4bc25";"Age and strength don't mean a
thing in these parts. You gotta
respect the chain of command.";
"4bc87";"Hey, are you new around here?";
"4bcab";"Wishful thinking, I guess!";
"4bccd";"Did you hear that?
Sounded like a woman
screaming...";
"4bd09";"She was a bit far off in the
distance, but she seemed pretty
from what I could tell.";
"4bd65";"I saw some human being
taken away by a flying
demon.";
"4bda1";"It looked like they were
going toward that door.";
"4bdd9";"Why can't I get
through that door?!";
"4be03";"Have you been looking for
the thief? You should be!";
"4be3d";"All of the treasure chests
around here have been looted.";
"4be7d";"The chests are empty. This
must have been the work of
some thief!";
"4bec5";"You'll catch a cold
out in this weather.";
"4bef5";"Your forehead feels
like it's on fire.
Guess you're healthy!";
"4bf39";"So you just pay me no mind,
and go about your business!";
"4bf77";"I was told we were practicing
marshal law here. Every demon
for itself.";
"4bfc5";"Don't turn your back to any of
us. It's too tempting to just...
attack!";
"4c013";"Lately, there have been a lot of
casualties at the hands of some
human. So don't get cocky!";
"4c075";"Hey. Do I know you?
Didn't think so.
Now go away.";
"4c0ad";"It's so damned cold
that I can see my
breath!";
"4c0e1";"...";
"4c0eb";"So he's received the guidance
of the Priests, has he?";
"4c127";"Seems to have an excess of
courage, that human...";
"4c15f";"...";
"4c169";"And what of the
preparations for
the ceremony?";
"4c19f";"...I see. Take
the offering to
the bell tower.";
"4c1d5";"You are to keep the flow
of sacrifices constant.";
"4c20d";"I shall ring the bell.";
"4c22b";"Are you convinced yet that he may
be a threat to our ambitions?";
"4c271";"The young swordsman, his path
shown to him by the Priests...";
"4c2b5";"...";
"4c2bf";"#c2#When Adol touched the door, his hand
slipped inside it, and his fingers were
numbed as if by an intense cold.";
"4c33b";"#c2#By all indications, the house was
abandoned. There was no sign of
anyone living there.";
"4c39d";"#c2#A handmade wedding dress
is hung on the wall.";
"4c3d5";"You, um...wouldn't happen
to be Adol, would you?";
"4c40d";"I beg you! Please bring my daughter
back to me! Please save my poor Maria!";
"4c45f";"I believe you are a messenger of
the Goddesses, under their divine
protection.";
"4c4b5";"Thank you for informing me
of my daughter's safety.";
"4c4ef";"I believe you are a messenger of
the Goddesses, under their divine
protection.";
"4c545";"And thank you, Adol, for
informing me of her safety.";
"4c581";"Almighty Goddesses, thank
you so much for keeping her
from harm! ";
"4c5c9";"Really? She's safe?!";
"4c5e5";"I just know she's still alive!";
"4c60b";"'There's something I
must do,' she says...";
"4c63d";"Somehow...it's like I can
hear Maria's voice in my
head, reassuring me...";
"4c68d";"Almighty Goddesses, please take
her into your light, for now and
ever more...";
"4c6e1";"On the fifth toll, I felt
as if something terrible
happened to Maria.";
"4c72d";"The bell rang again a
short while ago.";
"4c75b";"I know she is. I'm
her mother. I can
sense her presence.";
"4c79b";"For now, she's still alive.";
"4c7bd";"...I keep thinking this time,
it will be Maria's turn...";
"4c7fd";"Every time I hear the bell
toll in the Campanile of
Lane, I shudder...";
"4c84b";"Maria doesn't have long to live,
at this rate. Oh, my baby... Why?
Why did it have to be you...?";
"4c8b3";"She's been led away as
a sacrifice...";
"4c8df";"The demons were on the hunt
earlier, and they took away
my daughter, Maria...";
"4c933";"Maria... *sob*";
"4c949";"Oh, Maria... Why? Why
did it have to be you?!";
"4c97d";"Someone was just killed.
Not my daughter, but her
turn may be next...";
"4c9c9";"The tolling of the bell
means another sacrifice
is being offered.";
"4ca11";"Oh, no... The bell in the
Shrine is ringing again.";
"4ca4b";"(Please get out.
Please, get out.)";
"4ca75";"(Please get out.)";
"4ca8d";"...Well, I'm just glad
my family is safe.";
"4cabd";"For one would expect a collision,
with such forces in play. And if
that had happened...";
"4cb1b";"Perhaps the Goddesses
smiled upon us.";
"4cb47";"Ys has returned to the surface,
without a sound or shudder.";
"4cb89";"Either way, every time I hear that
bell toll, it sends a shiver down
my spine.";
"4cbdf";"How long has it been?";
"4cbfb";"Maria's mother has been in a terrible
state ever since it happened. She barely
says a word, and looks pale as a ghost.";
"4cc79";"And it's not just Ramia, either.
The monsters have been taking
sacrifices from all the villages!";
"4cce1";"There was a girl in this village
named Maria, who was recently taken
away by the demons.";
"4cd41";"And it's not just Ramia, either.
The monsters have been taking
sacrifices from all the villages!";
"4cda9";"Just the other day, a girl
named Maria was taken.";
"4cde1";"From time to time, demons come
pouring out of the Shrine, ransacking
the village for another sacrifice.";
"4ce4f";"Ramia's been in a bad way, lately.";
"4ce79";"(Must be a spy for
the demons...)";
"4cea1";"And now, I could conceivably
go anywhere... No restrictions!
It's a hard concept to imagine...";
"4cf07";"I used to always look down on the
surface, and imagine what it would
be like to stand down there...";
"4cf71";"The demons just keep getting stronger
and stronger...and eventually, they'll
simply wipe us ALL out.";
"4cfdd";"Really, the peace we've had in
this village has been a lie...";
"4d021";"Maria was Sada's fiancee. Poor
guy... I doubt he's taking it very
well. And can you blame him?";
"4d087";"It doesn't help that Karen's
daughter, Maria, was just
abducted as a sacrifice...";
"4d0df";"I just can't relax these days. I keep
thinking the demons could attack us at
any moment...";
"4d141";"Waaah...!";
"4d151";"I'm scared... What
are we gonna do?";
"4d17b";"...Mister, aren't you
afraid of the demons?";
"4d1ad";"I never wanna leave the
village. There are demons
out there! DEMONS!";
"4d1f9";"Huh... I've never seen a
Roo that color before.";
"4d22f";"...";
"4d239";"You're a Roo. And Roos don't
attack people. So heroo to yoo!";
"4d27d";"(Keep cool, keep cool...
It won't attack! It's just
a Roo! Roos are nice!)";
"4d2cf";"You're a Roo. And Roos don't
attack people. So heroo to yoo!";
"4d313";"Huh...? Don't
scare me like
that!";
"4d33b";"Ack! Where did
you come from?!";
"4d361";"It's mind-boggling!
Is this the power of
the Goddesses...?";
"4d3a3";"To even consider that Ys
could be returning to
the surface...";
"4d3e7";"If not, then...who in the
world was that?!";
"4d419";"Weren't you the guy who left
through the gate a while ago?";
"4d45b";"Huh?";
"4d467";"It's awesome to see.
Hang in there, man!
I'm rooting for you!";
"4d4ab";"You're causing quite a
stir among the demons.";
"4d4df";"You're causing quite a stir amongst
the demons. It's awesome to see. Hang
in there, man! I'm rooting for you!";
"4d553";"You're unbelievable!
Thank you so much!";
"4d581";"So you fixed all the
people who got turned
to stone?!";
"4d5bd";"...Damn those demons!";
"4d5d9";"Maria and her mother have always had a
very close relationship...more like
sisters than parent and child.";
"4d649";"You take care, now, y'hear?";
"4d66b";"It might not count for much, but I'm
going to stay ever-vigilant right here,
and warn everyone if they come back.";
"4d6e3";"We'd love to fight back, but
we just don't have the manpower
for it!";
"4d72f";"I know that if the demons come
out from the Shrine again, I'll
be the first one they attack.";
"4d793";"If they're looking for another sacrifice
I wish they'd just pick me, instead of
one of the more helpless innocents...";
"4d80f";"There's little I can do to assist
you, Adol, but I do wish you much
luck, and I pray for your safety.";
"4d87b";"Ys' descent back to the surface was like
the curtain rising on the final act.";
"4d8cf";"Who will win: demons or humans?
It's the battle of the century,
and we're all unwilling contenders!";
"4d939";"But there is still hope. It lives
on in the hearts of those like
you, Gorto and Sada.";
"4d995";"I just don't know what to believe
anymore... Everything's fallen into
utter chaos, all around me!";
"4d9fd";"Our time left in this world may be
short...but still, I pity the innocent
youth, like Maria. Poor Maria...";
"4da6f";"The only thing I can really do is
provide a warning if the demons
come out to hunt again.";
"4dacf";"My grandson, Gorto, is the gate guard,
and he means to serve that duty to his
dying breath. His dedication is amazing.";
"4db4d";"We put up with it, because our silent
acceptance seems to be the only reason
they haven't simply wiped us out yet.";
"4dbc7";"Such are the whims of fate...
Life sucks, then you die!";
"4dc05";"But as you can see, that shadow's
turned dark and sinister on us...";
"4dc4f";"Ramia Village used to be a thriving
temple town, sitting in the blissful
shadow of Solomon Shrine.";
"4dcb9";"Sardinette";
"4dccb";"Purrrrrrrr...";
"4dcdf";"Mrrrow...";
"4dcef";"Purrrr... ♪";
"4dd03";"Meyow... ♪";
"4dd15";"No";
"4dd1f";"Yes";
"4dd27";"Give smoked meat?";
"4dd3f";"No";
"4dd49";"Yes";
"4dd51";"Give raw meat?";
"4dd67";"Oh my, it's a Roo.
How adorable!";
"4dd8f";"Thank you so much! Why, I just
can't help but smile when I see
your face!";
"4dddf";"Are you here to raise my spirits,
little guy?";
"4de13";"I just get exhausted so easily these
days... My constitution is...well...
exhausting!";
"4de6f";"Thanks for your concern, but
really, I'll be fine in just
a moment. This happens a lot.";
"4decd";"I always give the apples I pick
to the other villagers.";
"4df0b";"Apples are quite popular
here in Lance Village.";
"4df41";"Remind me, sometime, and I'll show
you where the best apple trees can
be found!";
"4df97";"Adol, are you sure it's okay
for you to go outside?";
"4dfd1";"Leonor said you'd be fine, but I
couldn't help being worried until
I saw your recovery with my own eyes!";
"4e041";"...Thank goodness!";
"4e05b";"Here, I have an apple for you.
They say one each day keeps Dr.
Flair away!";
"4e0ad";"Remind me, sometime, and I'll show
you where the best apple trees can
be found!";
"4e103";"I picked it myself.";
"4e11d";"Eeeek! The demons...
They've come to Lance!";
"4e14f";"Man, just...look around! The clouds are
so high, I've got an amazing view of the
world below, like never before...";
"4e1c9";"I think I'll stay in here, thanks!";
"4e1f3";"Are the demons really out
hunting for human flesh...?";
"4e22f";"I think I'll stay in here, thanks!";
"4e259";"Are the demons really out
hunting for human flesh...?";
"4e295";"Not that that's a bad thing! We used to
always hear whispered voices...and some
kind of bell, too, recently.";
"4e309";"It's been pretty quiet
underground, lately.";
"4e33b";"If you ask me, it's in Gila's basement.
That place gives me the creeps like you
wouldn't believe!";
"4e3a3";"Granny Lucille said she
sensed something evil...";
"4e3db";"It's been pretty quiet
underground, lately.";
"4e40d";"Am I going crazy, or is there
something happening beneath the
streets of Lance Village?";
"4e46b";"And the other noises have been
a lot louder than before, too.";
"4e4af";"Been hearing this faint sound of
a bell ringing coming from somewhere
beneath my feet lately...";
"4e515";"What we need is a bell to keep
them away, NOT draw them in...";
"4e559";"There's a rumor going around that
it's the sound of some bell used
to summon demons.";
"4e5b5";"Have you heard the ringing sound
coming from beneath the village?";
"4e5fd";"Huh, it's a Roo. Don't see
those around here too often!";
"4e63b";"Ys has rejoined the world below?
How...ominous...";
"4e673";"I asked Astal and Leggs if they saw
her, but I guess she managed to give
them the slip. I sure hope she's okay...";
"4e6eb";"Banoa must be so worried...";
"4e70d";"Lilia went out to the ruins,
and that's the last anyone's
seen of her.";
"4e75b";"If you really are some kind of savior,
then won't you please use that power of
yours to get rid of the demons?";
"4e7d1";"He told me you're supposed to be the
savior of this land, led here by the
Goddesses themselves.";
"4e837";"I was just talking to Leggs.";
"4e85b";"If you're looking for Leggs, he's
gone back to the ruins. You'll find
him there, without a doubt.";
"4e8c3";"Just who are you, anyway?";
"4e8e3";"He seems really worked up over
something. And he usually only gets
excited like that about the Goddesses!";
"4e953";"Adol, right? Your red hair is a dead
giveaway. Leggs was just looking for
you. Go see him, when you have a moment.";
"4e9cd";"I swear, he's in love with that Goddess
statue. I don't know what he does with
it all day, and I don't WANT to know!";
"4ea49";"Leggs was in the ruins of Moondoria,
eh? Yeah, THERE'S a shocker...";
"4ea93";"In fact, I'll bet he's off at the
ruins again right now, staring at
that Goddess statue all creepily...";
"4eb01";"Leggs is always going on
and on about it...";
"4eb33";"I heard there used to be six kinds
of magic in Ys, one handed down by
each of the six Priests.";
"4eb99";"...Most likely me.";
"4ebb3";"You want a fight? You steppin'?!
Somebody's gonna get hurt, yo!";
"4ebf9";"It's like we've fallen back to the
surface world...";
"4ec33";"Am I...hallucinating or something?
It looks like the ground now stretches
off into the sky, past the edges of Ys.";
"4ecab";"I'm still worried about Lilia,
but at least we know that Bohtz
is alive and well.";
"4ed03";"It's hard to believe, but he says all
the people who were kidnapped were taken
to the big shrine above the ice ridge!";
"4ed7f";"Have you heard? Bohtz is back,
safe and sound!";
"4edb5";"We've had a peaceful life here in Ys
for so many centuries... Why are all
these calamities happening now?!";
"4ee27";"And Bohtz hasn't come back from
Rasteenie Mine, either...";
"4ee67";"Have you heard? Apparently,
Lilia just...vanished...
without a trace!";
"4eeb3";"But...she's doing better now, right?";
"4eedf";"I heard Lilia was really sick...";
"4ef07";"Apparently, he also gathered
a few more much-needed herbs,
which is excellent news.";
"4ef61";"Lazlo seems ecstatic to have finally
gotten his hands on some iron ore
again, after all this time.";
"4efcb";"Astal is standing guard
at the entrance.";
"4effb";"The Rasteenie Mine is practically a
death trap these days, so no one can
enter without the elder's permission.";
"4f071";"The lack of ore and the monsters
alike are causing no end of grief
for Bohtz and the other miners.";
"4f0db";"It was closed a long time ago when the
ore deposits started drying up. And then
six months ago, the demons showed up...";
"4f159";"There's an old mine under
the Ruins of Moondoria.";
"4f191";"I wonder if the demons
really speak their own
language...";
"4f1d1";"...Why aren't you more excited?!";
"4f1f9";"Ys is back on solid ground, after
what...seven hundred years? I saw
it with my own two eyes!";
"4f25d";"So I'm sure you've heard, but if you're
anything like me, you probably don't
believe it. It's really true, though...";
"4f2d9";"...Well, hopefully, anyway.";
"4f2fb";"I don't know how to thank you.
Finally, at long last, I'll be
able to get some sleep!";
"4f357";"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";
"4f399";"Have you noticed it's been
getting warmer lately?";
"4f3d1";"Temperature increases...demonic voices
from underground... Yeah, I think I'm
going to interpret these as ill omens!";
"4f44b";"Hey, have you noticed it's
been getting warmer lately?";
"4f489";"Which reminds me...I should get
some sleep right now! I'm BEAT!";
"4f4cf";"I don't know how to thank you.
Finally, at long last, I'll be
able to get some sleep!";
"4f52b";"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";
"4f56d";"Rumor has it the demons are specifically
hunting human beings, though I really,
REALLY hope that's just panic talking.";
"4f5eb";"There's been a sharp increase in the
number of disappearances recently. Just
one more thing to worry about, I guess!";
"4f667";"What is this world coming to?
Isn't there anything anyone can
do about all this?!";
"4f6bf";"Add to that all the recent talk of
demons going out and actively hunting
for humans, and yeah...rest easy? Ha!";
"4f735";"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";
"4f79b";"And they're gone! HURRAH!
Full night of restful sleep,
here I (hopefully) come!";
"4f7f1";"...So I was right! It WAS demons!";
"4f819";"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";
"4f85b";"If only someone would find
them and take them out...";
"4f897";"...Don't know why I think that.
But I do. I just...have a gut
feeling about it.";
"4f8ed";"It's demons! I just know it!
Demons lurking in every nook
and cranny under this village!";
"4f94d";"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";
"4f9b3";"If only someone would find
them and take them out...";
"4f9ef";"...Don't know why I think that.
But I do. I just...have a gut
feeling about it.";
"4fa45";"It's demons! I just know it!
Demons lurking in every nook
and cranny under this village!";
"4faa5";"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";
"4fb0b";"I haven't had a good night's sleep
in WEEKS. If this doesn't stop soon,
I swear I'm going to lose it...";
"4fb79";"Maybe it's all in my head,
but it just seems so REAL...";
"4fbb7";"...When I go to bed at night, I hear the
most dreadful screaming and clattering
coming from beneath the village.";
"4fc2f";"Hey, can I tell you something?
Just between you and me? Swear
you won't tell another soul?";
"4fc91";"Bite me and you're dead.";
"4fcb1";"I've got special armor on.";
"4fcd3";"I wish I could make armor again, but
I've got no metal to use-- and no,
pikkard-skin doesn't work, believe me!";
"4fd49";"I haven't been able to go down into
the mine to look for iron ore since
the demons showed up.";

any evil about you. What kind
of demon might you be?!";
"502d5";"Oh, dear... A demon? You must
have somehow gotten past my
son, Larsen.";
50323;"I think this may be the day I've
been waiting for all this time...";
"5036d";"I haven't seen it for myself yet,
but I've heard... Ys has fallen
back to the surface. Back home.";
"503d5";"And what will become of Ys...?";
"503fb";"Demons everywhere, people vanishing...
What is happening to this world?";
50449;"I sense that the evil presence
there has been vanquished. There
is no longer any threat.";
"504a9";"I see...so Gila's basement
really was infested with
demons?";
"504eb";"We can't just leave them like that...
They could come up into the village and
cause all manner of trouble!";
"5055d";"By the Goddesses, do you mean to tell
me there really ARE demons living in
Gila's basement?!";
"505c1";"I hate to be a pessimist, but
what if there are demons down
there?!";
"5060b";"I feel an evil presence in
Gila's basement...";
"5063f";"I'm disgusting. All tough, and
stringy... Not fit for monster
consumption in any way, I swear!";
"506a5";"I wonder if there's anyone left to
spread it TO, though. Most have likely
begun to notice by now, as I should've!";
"5071d";"It's not just some baseless rumor? It
actually happened?! ...By the Goddesses,
I need to go out and spread the word!";
50799;"Whoa, whoa, whoa... Do you mean
to tell me that Ys actually DID
return to the surface?!";
"507f7";"...NOT! Haha, I had you going there for
a moment! To believe such a preposterous
rumor... Ah, the naivete of youth!";
50871;"Just between you and me...I hear
tell that Ys will be falling back
to the surface soon...";
"508d1";"Have you noticed that it's been
getting warmer lately?";
"5090f";"But we mustn't discount the possibility.
Supposedly, the hunted are being taken
away to some undisclosed location...";
"5098b";"No? ...A second rumor states that demons
have been hunting humans who leave this
place. Hopefully JUST a rumor, that!";
"50a07";"There's a rumor going around that
Lilia followed you out of the
village. Have you seen her?";
"50a69";"So, it really does exist! It seems
rumors around here tend toward
validity...";
"50abd";"That tablet you're holding...
That's not the one I was telling
you about, is it?";
"50b15";"But remember, you wouldn't know about
it if it weren't for me. So I'll be
expecting a cut of the loot!";
"50b83";"With that tablet, you might be able
to learn something useful about the
Sanctuary of Toal.";
"50be5";"So, it really does exist! It seems
rumors around here tend toward
validity...";
"50c39";"Wait... That tablet in your hands is the
one I was just talking about, isn't it?
Is that why you're grinning at me?!";
"50cb5";"Supposedly, it details a mystical
location known as the 'Sanctuary
of Toal.'";
"50d09";"I hear a lot of rumors, and one speaks
of an old stone tablet enshrined within
the Ruins of Moondoria.";
"50d77";"But remember, you wouldn't be looking
for it if not for my advice. So be sure
to share any treasures you find with me!";
"50df5";"If you had that tablet, you might
be able to learn something useful
about the Sanctuary of Toal.";
"50e5d";"Finding it might make for an interesting
goal to set in your adventure, if you
should feel so inclined.";

location known as the 'Sanctuary
of Toal.'";

"50f8d";"It's a d-d-d-d-d-MONSTER!";
"50fad";"Has our little floating island
really turned into a big over-
world now? I wanna see, I wanna see!";
51017;"But where did she go...?";
51037;"I think you and Lilia are on
the right track, mister!";
51073;"I wonder where Lilia went...";
51097;"Wow, you really saved
Lilia? Thanks, mister!";
"510cb";"That's pretty cool!
Maybe I had you pegged
all wrong!";
51107;"Are you the one who
rescued Dr. Rall,
mister?";
"5113b";"That's pretty impressive,
mister...but don't you go
getting a big head over it!";
51191;"Whoa... You killed that
demon in the old mine?";
"511c7";"There's s'posed to be a real
big one in the ruins. One that
can't be hurt by normal weapons.";
"5122b";"If you haven't wiped out all the
demons there, though, then you don't
get bragging rights just yet!";
51295;"Hmm. You went to
Moondoria, huh?";
"512bd";"'Far, far away'? Mister, there's nothing
far from here! Just because I'm a kid,
do you think I'm stupid or something?!";
"5133b";"I haven't seen you before,
mister... Where are you
from?";
"5137b";"Eeyaargh!";
"5138b";"Does this mean I can go farther
away when I want to play now?!";
"513d1";"Oh, wow... Oh, wow!
I can't believe Ys is
on the ground now!";
51415;"You gotta go look for her, okay?
You just gotta!";
"5144d";"Lilia's gone...and I dunno
where she went!";
"5147f";"Now she can come play
with me again! Yaaay!";
"514b1";"Lilia got all better!
That's soooo cool!";
"514e1";"Awesome... Awesome!";
"514fb";"Dr. Rall's been rescued!
That's soooo cool!";
"5152d";"Awesome... Awesome!";
51547;"You're on an adventure
to find Dr. Rall?
That's soooo cool!";
51589;"Awesome... Awesome!";
"515a3";"That tablet's soooo cool!";
"515c3";"Awesome... Awesome!";
"515dd";"Those books you've got
are soooo cool!";
"5160b";"Awesome... Awesome!";
51625;"You look positively scrumptious,
my little furry friend!";
51665;"(Might be good smoked and cured...)";
"5168f";"The below-lands are really warm! And...
not below anymore! I wonder if they have
pikkards in this strange new world...";
"5170d";"I know what you're gonna say.
That Ys fell to the surface.
And that it's soooo cool.";
51769;"*sigh* She's such a goofball...";
"5178f";"My sister sings this weird little
song whenever she goes to look
after the pikkards.";
"517eb";"If she's still attached to them once
they're all fat and juicy, she is NOT
going to like what happens next...";
"5185f";"That little twerp says she's
going to name one after me,
though...";
"518a9";"I've been letting my little sister,
Lucy, name all the newborn pikkards.";
"518f9";"So...we're raising them here.
And my annoying little sister
likes to keep an eye on them!";
51959;"But with all the demons running
around these days, I can't put
them out to pasture anymore.";
"519bb";"Hey, I'm Theo. I raise
pikkards here.";
"519e7";"Eeek?!";
"519f5";"The sunlight feels different... The air
TASTES different... Really, nothing at
all is the same!";
"51a5b";"So, this is...well, the world!";
"51a81";"I can't even hazard a guess
as to what it all means...";
"51abf";"The clouds seem like they're right
up alongside us, and the wind feels
a lot calmer...";
"51b1d";"The sky's been looking real
peculiar lately.";
"51b51";"As for the rest of us...
All we can do is pray.";
"51b87";"...She probably ran AFTER you, though.
So Adol, please... Try to find her!
You may very well be her only hope!";
"51bfd";"I was worried that she might have run
off with a certain someone, but you're
not smiling big enough for that!";
"51c71";"Adol... Lilia's gone. She
just up and vanished!";
"51ca7";"I hear Lilia's been sick.
I didn't even know...";
"51cdd";"I promise I won't tell anyone
else! C'mon! Just between us!";
"51d1f";"Which begs the question...
How do you REALLY feel
about her?";
"51d63";"I hear that you went really
deep into the abandoned mine
on her behalf.";
"51db1";"Thank you for helping
Lilia, Adol.";
"51ddb";"Also...the demons rarely leave
the ruins, but you never can be
too careful, so stay alert!";
"51e3d";"I'd stay away from the cliff edge
if I were you, though. No one can
possibly catch you if you fall!";
"51ea7";"On a nice day like this, there's
nothing like a nice, simple walk
through the field.";
"51f03";"Good morning. It's another
lovely day, isn't it?";
"51f3b";"And you, you're not so bad-looking
yourself! You never know... You two
might be a match made in heaven!";
"51fa9";"Haha... You know, she's a very
pretty young lady. And as sweet
as a bucket of sugar!";
52005;"You look well. Feeling better,
I take it? Lilia was worried sick
about you!";
52057;"You're the traveler who's been
staying at Lilia's house, no?";
"5209b";"Animals have it so easy.
Not a care in the world!";
"520d3";"*siiiiiigh*";
"520e5";"I wasn't sighing at all!
Just, um, taking in the
fresh air! Yeah, that's it!";
52139;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";
"5215f";"*siiiiiigh*";
52171;"Second loves are where it's at!";
52197;"I suppose that's just one
of life's little lessons.";
"521d1";"Well, ever heard the saying, 'Nothing
ever comes of first loves'? Yeah...
It's totally true.";
52235;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";
"5225b";"*siiiiiigh*";
"5226d";"Someday, you'll experience
it too. And on that day...
you will feel my pain.";
"522c1";"...Hey, don't look at
me like that!";
"522eb";"I'm telling you, I'd die for her!";
52313;"She's like an angel
in a white robe...";
52341;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?
Well, why does ANYONE sigh?
Unrequited love, of course!";
"5239f";"*siiiiiigh*";
"523b1";"I'm not willing to risk it, though.
Not with all those demons around!";
"523fd";"It was divinely scrumptious. If I could
eat just one more in my lifetime, then
I feel as if I could die happy.";
52473;"I was just thinking about the
heavenly taste of that Roda
Fruit I found in the ruins once...";
"524d7";"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";
"524fd";"*siiiiiigh*";
"5250f";"Can't I just pledge my devotion
to you, in exchange for you not
killing me...?";
52565;"I...I don't wanna die!";
52583;"Yikes!";
52591;"Doesn't the air feel...odd to you?
I feel so at peace right now...
and it's like the wind does, too!";
"525fd";"It's not safe for a
young girl to be by
herself out there...";
52641;"Just when she's been cured of
her sickness, she up and
vanishes!";
52689;"Ah, Adol. Have you seen Lilia?";
"526af";"I'm so very relieved. Your
devotion is...inspirational!";
"526ed";"Lilia's going to make it.
And it's all thanks to you.";
52729;"First she saves you, and now, you
save her. It's like a storybook
romance!";
"5277b";"Quickly, go deliver the
medicine. Banoa will be
overjoyed!";
"527bd";"I give you...my devotion!";
"527dd";"...Well, I have ONE thing,
I suppose...";
"5280b";"...Which I mean quite literally.
I'd LIKE to offer you a token of my
thanks, but I have nothing to give!";
"5287b";"I really appreciate what you did
for my brother. I'd like to offer
you a token of my thanks.";
"528df";"All I can offer is my devotion.";
52905;"I am but a humble caregiver.";
52929;"I'm sorry... I don't have
anything tangible to give.";
52965;"You're already up and about?
You must heal quickly. If only
we were ALL so lucky!";
"529bd";"Hey there, Adol.";
"529d5";"I do hope he comes back soon...";
"529fb";"My brother went to gather herbs,
but he has yet to return.";
"52a3d";"I'm studying to become a doctor, but for
the moment, I am merely an apprentice. A
caregiver, if you will. With devotion.";
"52abd";"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";
"52b0b";"I have a wife and two
young daughters.";
"52b39";"Please, spare me.";
"52b51";"Whatever happens next, it won't be as
bad as a kidnapping by demons. I can
think of no worse fate!";
"52bbb";"Go on, you should get back
to the village. Banoa will be
delighted to see you!";
"52c11";"Thank goodness! Where did you
go after you disappeared down
in that canal?";
"52c63";"Lilia's been found?!";
"52c7f";"I have a wife and two daughters at
home, you see, so I simply can't
afford to risk my life like that!";
"52ceb";"Because of the demons in the mine, I
haven't been able to get in there to
restock iron ore OR medicinal herbs.";
"52d61";"Oh, dear... I just don't know what to
do. I don't think I can face either Dr.
Flair or Lazlo, as things stand.";
"52ddb";"Maybe it's a portent of good
fortune for the village.";
"52e1b";"Ah, a Roo. It's rare to see one
of your kind around here...and
usually, it's a good omen.";
"52e7f";"Ys is no different. It is
returning to the spot where
it belongs...";
"52ecd";"Everything is coming full circle.
All things inevitably wind up
where they are meant to be.";
"52f33";"Has the time come, at long
last, for Ys to return to
the surface...?";
"52f83";"The sky is different than I
remember it. Could Ys perhaps
be losing altitude?";
"52fdb";"It's little comfort, but it's all I
have. So I'm going to believe that
wherever she is, she is all right.";
"5304f";"...I suppose she did manage to beat a
serious illness, though, so perhaps
fortune favors her...";
"530b9";"Where could she have run off to?
The demons are everywhere... She
shouldn't be out there by herself!";
53129;"Oh, Adol... It's terrible.
Lilia's gone missing!";
53165;"You were brought here for a
reason, Adol Christin. It is
up to you to decipher it.";
"531c3";"I'm sure your destiny will become
clear forthwith, along with the
purpose of those powers granted you.";
53235;"So, you've returned all the
Books of Ys, have you?";
53273;"Perhaps we should form
a search party...";
"532a7";"So you've returned all the books,
have you? But still no sign of Dr.
Flair? Troubling news, indeed...";
53317;"Go! That book must be returned
if anything is to come of this!";
53361;"...Wait, you still haven't
returned the book? What are
you waiting for?!";
"533b5";"Ahh, so Gila's basement is connected
to the sanctuary of Priest Fact? That
does explain things!";
"5341f";"Hmmm... No luck finding
Priest Fact's sanctuary,
you say?";
53463;"I believe Lance Village was once
part of Moondoria, so perhaps the
clue may lie right under our feet...";
"534d5";"There must be a
clue somewhere!";
"534ff";"What could it mean? I rather
doubt it's located anywhere
else...";
"5354b";"When all six books have been returned
to the Priests, you may learn the
nature of your destiny here in Ys.";
"535c1";"I would recommend you visit these
rooms, and return the Books of Ys
to the hands of their writers.";
"5362f";"Statues of the Priests have been
erected within these rooms.";
53677;"There are a series of rooms in the
Rasteenie Mine which are collectively
known as the 'Sanctuary of Toal.'";
"536ed";"As Elder of this village, you
have my sincerest thanks.";
"5372f";"Oh, Adol! I'm told you brought
Dr. Flair back to us, alive and
unharmed.";
53783;"Anyway...I understand you have six
ancient books with you. Might I
please have a look at them?";
"537ed";"Maybe I was just hallucinating...";
53819;"Without thinking, I began tailing
them for a short while...but then,
they simply disappeared!";
53881;"I would have asked them their names,
but I was taken aback by their beauty.
They looked just like the Goddesses...";
"538ff";"I was walking in the ruins the other day
when I crossed ways with a pair of young
girls. Were they also from the surface?";
53983;"My name is Cornell. I serve as this
village's elder. And I actually have
a question for you...";
"539ed";"Ah, you must be the man Lilia
found out in the field. Adol,
was it?";
"53a37";"#c2#Adol showed the Books of Ys
to the elder.";

but if you tell him that I've given my
blessing, he'll let you through.";

"53bc1";"I believe your next course of action
should be to return the books to the
hands of these statues.";

known as the Sanctuary of Toal, where a
statue of each Priest has been erected.";

and memories of one of
the six Priests.";
"53cf9";"These may very well serve as proof
that the Priests themselves have
guided you here to Ys.";
"53d5f";"Hmm... Yes, there's no doubt about it.
These are the books that the Priests of
Ys handed down to their descendants.";
"53ddd";"But do be careful. I'm sure you'll hear
this a lot, but it's true: You may very
well be our only hope, Adol Christin!";
"53e5d";"You should have no trouble,
I'd think. After all, the
Priests are guiding you!";
"53eb7";"Will you be going to his aid?";
"53edf";"...What? Flair's been involved
in an accident in the mine?!
That's terrible news!";

to the Priests, you may learn the
nature of your destiny here in Ys.";
"53fb1";"I would recommend you visit these
rooms, and return the Books of Ys

erected within these rooms.";

earlier?! Dammit, I need to sleep
with one eye open from now on!";
54141;"Crap! The demons have infiltrated
the village! Everybody, RUN!";
54187;"There used to be an endless expanse
of blue sky, but now it's land and
water, as far as the eye can see...";
"541f9";"It's hard for me to accept that
Ys is now back on the surface.";

things to come...";
54273;"Something's looked a bit off
with them for the last little
while, though.";

here, you can get a good view
of the clouds floating by.";
54323;"I hope she's safe,
wherever she is...";
"5434f";"And Astal hasn't seen her,
so we really have no leads
on where she might have gone.";

day Lilia vanished, so only Astal was
actually out in the ruins at the time.";
54425;"Adol, right? Excellent work,
Adol! I don't know what we'd
do if we ever lost Lilia.";
"5447f";"You must be the guy!";

red-haired traveler somehow got his
hands on the medicine's ingredients.";

was even sick.";

sleepy. But don't worry! I won't nod
off, I swear! ...Not for long, anyway...";

the village safe. I pledge
my life to Lance!";

by the second. Best watch out, or you'll
wind up a gibbering mass of muscles!";

did you? Very nicely done!";

ago, so it's gotten kind of difficult

peace or one of suffering...is entirely

honest-to-goodness hero. A real
credit to the Goddesses' names.";

for just another shiftless
young man...";
58345;"Your path will surely

Steel your courage and prepare to face
the truth of the world.";

key to exceeding your own limits, and
accomplishing superhuman feats.";

import. They will no doubt prove
essential to your goal.";

Priests once used still exist
somewhere in Ys.";
"584ff";"Swordsman...";
58513;"It's just what I always assumed
would be in that treasure chest!";
"5855b";"Swordsman... That which you
hold is none other than the
Rod of Divinity.";
"585ab";"From this point on, your
magic power shall surely
show you the way!";
"585f5";"If you touch the Rod upon the Goddess
statue, I believe you will receive the
ability to use magic.";
"5865f";"The Rod of Divinity signifies one who is
worthy to lead. The magic of the Priests
shall be inherited only by its bearer.";
"586df";"The statue up ahead
represents the two
Goddesses of Ys.";
"5871d";"My name, believe it or not, is
Leggs. But you may call me the
Leg-Man, if you so desire!";
"5877d";"Ahh, wait, I know! You're the
boy Banoa was looking after.
Adol, was it?";
"587cd";"Hehh? Who might you be?!";
"587ed";"Even I don't come out here
without a Short Sword...and
I know this area well!";
58841;"Do you have a death wish?";
58861;"No weapon? In THESE ruins?!
You're a loon, young man!";
"5889d";"Here, I have a spare one
I can give you. Take it,
please! You'll need it!";
"588ed";"...If you believe you can, I'd ask that
you defeat the demons over yonder, and
bring me the treasure they guard.";
58965;"Still, your sword alone may not
be enough to defeat all of the
enemies who stand before you.";
"589c9";"You seem to have some
considerable sword
experience.";
"58a05";"...No, best if I don't. You're not
yet strong enough to handle the
power of the Priests.";
"58a65";"You look like like a swordsman
of some skill. As such, I have
a favor to ask of you...";
"58ac7";"Hmm? Oh, it's a Roo. Where
did you come from, little
fellow?";
"58b0b";"It's easy to see: All I need to do
is look to the sky. Everything seems
so much farther away...";
"58b71";"...I understand that Ys has
fallen back to the surface.";
"58baf";"Hey, Adol.";
"58bc5";"It's just hard to keep a positive
attitude, under the circumstances.
I'm trying...but it's very hard.";
"58c35";"And I'm sure she IS fine,
wherever she is.";
"58c6b";"Banoa told me to keep my
spirits up about Lilia.";
"58ca7";"Lilia possesses good fortune to have
overcome her illness...and I believe
that fortune will see her through.";
"58d1f";"Perhaps my mind had wandered.
If only I'd been paying closer
attention...";
"58d73";"Apparently, Lilia came here, and
now she's missing. But I certainly
didn't see her...";
"58dd3";"If anything happens to Lilia,
I take full responsibility for
it. I'm so very, very sorry...";
"58e39";"Brrr! Gives me the chills,
just thinking about it!";
"58e77";"...What?! HOW big?! My goodness...
To think there'd be such a massive
creature beneath my feet all this time!";

sense any evil presence coming
from the mine anymore...";

demons around here
would follow suit...";
"58f95";"I'm so glad you vanquished the
fiend from Rasteenie Mine.";
"58fd9";"Outstanding!";
"58ff1";"Dr. Flair told me he was rescued
by a red-haired boy. I take it he
was referring to you, then?";
"5905b";"I'm quite impressed that you
were able to rescue Dr. Flair
from the abandoned mine.";
"590b9";"And even then...it's usually
just Dr. Flair himself. So do
be careful down there, okay?";
"5911b";"The villagers don't go down
there at all anymore, save for
when they need medicinal herbs.";
59181;"There are a lot of demons
roaming the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine these days...";
"591d9";"You got the elder's permission?
...All right. Can't argue with
that! You're free to go in.";

"592c1";"Hey there. I'm Astal,
from Lance Village.";
"592f5";"So, you've come to rescue
him, then, I suppose?";
"5932f";"What's that you say? Dr.
Flair's been involved in
a cave-in?! How awful!";
59383;"But I can't open this door without the
elder's express... Oh, you have permis-
sion? Well, then! In you go!";
"593f9";"It's a shame you didn't come by
earlier, as he was actually here
for a visit until just recently.";
59465;"As long as he didn't get side-tracked
somewhere, though, he should be home by
now. So it should only take a moment!";
"594e3";"I'm sorry to sound so bureaucratic,
but we created this law for a reason.
The mine is a real death-trap!";
59557;"You'll need the elder's permission
to enter the mine, I'm afraid. You'd
best go and speak with him.";
"595c5";"Hey, you look confused.
Is something the matter?";
59601;"You're Adol, right? It's good

rather worried about him!";
"5998d";"He went there to gather herbs
for medicine, but he's been
gone an awfully long time...";
"599ef";"Leonor's the one who looked after
you, no? Makes sense, with Dr. Flair
down in the mine.";
"59a53";"I can't let you in
without permission
from the elder, though.";
"59a9b";"The abandoned mine is
just through here.";
"59acf";"Don't know why he'd ever expect
strange young girls to wander
through a place like this, though...";

ahead. If you ain't got a leaf,
you'll never make it through!";

boiled or fried?";

yummy? I'll be gladol when
he's in my tummy!";

enjoys. So I like to procrastinate, just
to see him get angry.";

those fruits, don'tcha?";

wait'll he gets a load
of ME...";
"5c2ab";"So...a Roo, huh? How's that working out
for you? ...Also, you got any fruit? I
hear Roos eat some great stuff!";
"5c321";"Well, we're dead. The captives have been
freed, and Adol managed to get past our
little blockade. Failure, all around!";
"5c39f";"Can't believe they'd do something
so reckless. If he dies, then he's
not useful to us anymore, you know?";
"5c40f";"I heard the bridge guard's son
was taken through the poison
gas area.";
"5c45b";"Make sure he hasn't betrayed us.
Ruba's his name, and if he's plotting
something, his son gets it!";
"5c4c5";"Will you go check on that
bridge guard at the Colony
of Lava for me?";
"5c511";"Hey you... Yeah, you!
Cutesy McRedhair!
Got a job for you.";
"5c553";"...That fruit of yours! You've got some,
right? I'll trade you some adventurer's
shank for just a little piece of it!";
"5c5cf";"Psst. Hey, Roo. How much for
a little...you know...";
"5c609";"Gah... When it's this hot, I just feel
like going on a total rampage. Just...
goring anything that moves. You know?";
"5c683";"It's too damned hot here, but then
if we go to the Ice Ridge, it's too
cold! How does that even work?!";
"5c6f1";"...But I kinda like it!";
"5c70f";"I think I'm melting...";
"5c72d";"Specifically, the Monster Worker's
Alliance for Halflings, Ancients,
Halberdiers and Armorshells: MWAHAHA.";
"5c79f";"But I'm not allowed to take a break! Not
a one! I knew I should've joined the
union. The Monster Worker's Alliance...";
"5c81b";"I haven't been feeling
too well lately...";
"5c84b";"I could go for mouthing a
big hunk of that Ice Ridge
right about now...";
"5c899";"Ugh, it's soooo hot... All I want
right now is a nice, frosty glass
of humanade!";
"5c8f1";"I'm in a hurry.
Please leave me be.";
"5c91b";"True story!";
"5c92d";"Apparently that coward,
Adol, is so afraid of me
that he ran away.";
"5c977";"How ironic!";
"5c989";"I heard Adol killed the very demon
who was summoned to kill him.";
"5c9d1";"But a huge demon's been summoned to take
him out, as a last resort contingency
plan. So he's toast, if he does!";
"5ca47";"If the bridge guard turns
traitor on us, Adol will no
doubt be coming this way.";
"5ca9d";"So...how about that scorching heat?
Sure is unpleasant, isn't it?";
"5cae5";"I'm sweating so much, I
think I might dry up!";
"5cb19";"Halt! Who goes there?!";
"5cb37";"I'm really sensitive to heat.
Not what you'd expect, is it?";
"5cb79";"...Ominous!";
"5cb8b";"That red-haired Adol's been going around
killing us all. He even got Gelaldy, who
was hired specifically to stop him!";
"5cc07";"I will now tell you my terrible
secret. Prepare to receive this
bad medicine!";
"5cc5b";"Unless Adol can beat him,
there's no way through.";
"5cc93";"Even if the bridge guard betrays
us, we still have an ace in the
hole up ahead.";
"5cce9";"Just goes to show you that good
looks don't equal power, y'know?";
"5cd31";"Looks like Adol was too much
for Gelaldy, after all.";
"5cd6d";"...And I'm not talking about
bloodsprout syndrome!";
"5cda7";"We've got a new demon in
place up ahead, to rid us
of our red-haired plague.";
"5cdfb";"Yeah... Adol actually beat
him. I can't believe it!";
"5ce35";"You know that guy up ahead?
The giant cranium?";
"5ce6b";"He's just up ahead.
You should go say hi!";
"5ce9b";"This huge guy came here not too long
ago, specifically to take down Adol
in case he makes it this far.";
"5cf09";"I swear, the next time Adol
comes here will be his last!";
"5cf49";"He's a cruel swine.
I'll bet he was cursed
at birth.";
"5cf85";"We're easy pickings for
that red-haired human,
these days.";
"5cfc7";"You just can't trust
humans, you know?";
"5cff5";"I should go check on him.
...Or YOU should, perhaps...
...So that I don't have to!";
"5d04f";"I wonder if that Ruba guy's
doing what we asked...";
"5d089";"Worst of all, though, is this 'love'
thing. I don't even know what love is,
but if it's THAT strong, I want some!";
"5d101";"Usually, they're simpering cowards...
but whether by courage or fellowship,
they can sometimes be a royal pain!";
"5d177";"The scariest thing about humans
is their persistence.";
"5d1b3";"*sigh* Gotta do what you
gotta do, I guess!";
"5d1e5";"It's almost time for my shift.
I have to go check up on that
bridge guard.";
"5d237";"You just can't trust humans, you know?";
"5d265";"As long as the bridge guard does
what he's told, Adol won't be able
to get anywhere near Solomon Shrine.";
"5d2d5";"Gelaldy was actually beaten
by a lowly human? Oh, my!";
"5d311";"...You know, this game of cat and mouse
we've been playing with Adol. I'm quite
enjoying it. What did you THINK I meant?";
"5d391";"I hate the fact that we take hostages.
But if we didn't, this game would be
way too short!";
"5d3f3";"The village is the
other way, mister!";
"5d41f";"Mister, I'm kinda worried.
We seem to be getting farther
and farther from the village...";
"5d47f";"Mister... Your sense of
direction is terrible!";
"5d4b5";"It's a hard-knock life...";
"5d4d5";"Don't tell Lord Dalles
I've been slacking off.
Promise you won't!";
"5d51d";"C'mon, let's get going!";
"5d53b";"Thanks!";
"5d549";"That's cold, mister!";
"5d565";"So, you wanna escort me back to the
village? I mean, I'm a defenseless
little kid, so it'd be mean to say no!";
"5d5d9";"No";
"5d5e3";"Yes";
"5d5eb";"Escort Tarf back to his home?";
"5d60f";"Here, try to pass it to me
through the gap in the wall!";
"5d64d";"Huh? You have the
#c2#Black Pearl#c#?";
"5d679";"Just a little more to the
right... Almost got it...";
"5d6b3";"Okay, hold it! Right
there! Awesome, I can
feel it!";
"5d6ed";"All right, I've got it!
Thanks, mister!";
"5d71b";"My cellmate here says you
should stand back! I think
he's gonna do something!";
"5d76f";"Hey! You out there!";
"5d789";"(Wait, what do you mean,
'Tell him to get back'?!)";
"5d7c3";"You're leaving?";
"5d7d9";"...Huh? Keith, where
are you going?";
"5d803";"All right! We're out!
We're freeeeee!";
"5d82f";"Keith!";
"5d83d";"He's gone...";
"5d851";"Never seen anything like it before!";
"5d87b";"He was also really nice. A kind, well-
behaved, intelligent demon.";
"5d8c5";"From what I could tell, he'd been in
here a lot longer than me.";
"5d90b";"Even though he's not human, he can speak
our language. And I really wasn't scared
to be around him. He was fun to talk to!";
"5d98d";"Keith is a demon who was locked in here
with me.";
"5d9c5";"I was finally starting to get really
hungry, though, so I'm glad you came
when you did!";
"5da23";"With Keith in here, I almost didn't
mind getting kidnapped-- even though
it's been almost two full days.";
"5da93";"Anyway, thanks for your help, mister!";
"5dabf";"Why would something like that happen?
Just looks like a rock to me!";
"5db09";"But when I handed him the #c2#Black Pearl#c#,
he suddenly turned...vicious. Like a
normal demon. Then he broke the wall.";
"5db89";"The demon who shut me in here was
telling the others to look for a
red-haired swordsman named Adol.";
"5dbf3";"...Oh, hey, are you Adol, by any chance?";
"5dc23";"But, you came to rescue me, so
I guess all is forgiven!";
"5dc61";"Y'know, I was kinda wondering if
you're the reason I got locked up
in there...";
"5dcb7";"#c2#...But he realized no one would
be able to understand his words
in his current form.";
"5dd17";"#c2#Adol shouted through the gap in
the rock wall that he had the
Black Pearl...";
"5dd6f";"So if you can look around
for it, we'd both really
appreciate it!";
"5ddb7";"If you can find it, Keith says
he can use his strength to get
us outta here!";
"5de0b";"Keith was just telling me
that he wants you to bring
him the #c2#Black Pearl#c#.";
"5de63";"#c2#...But he realized no one would
be able to understand his words

through the crack in the wall, and
tried calling out to their source.";

"5dfaf";"This stone wall's really solid, so
unless you're a big mass of muscles,
I don't think you can knock it down!";

to rescue me?";

speaking with someone on
the other side of the wall.";

find it, okay?";

it here, Keith says he can break the
wall and set us free!";
"5e175";"He says he wants you to find him
something called the '#c2#Black Pearl#c#.'";
"5e1c7";"Keith asked me to
tell you something.";
"5e1f3";"Hey! You still there?";
"5e20f";"(So you need what, exactly? Those are
some pretty specific tastes... Ohhhh,
PEARL! Okay. I thought you said 'girl'!)";
"5e28b";"#c2#Adol peered into the crack in the
wall, but it was too dark to see
anything on the other side.";
"5e2f5";"#c2#There's some writing
carved into the rock.";
"5e32b";"I don't know how, though. It
was so dark, we could barely
see anything!";
"5e379";"Keith did that.";
"5e38f";"Don't you know I'm unscarable?
Sheesh! You're not very good
at playing pranks, are you?";
"5e3ed";"You're Mister Adol! I can tell
by the hair! You think you can
scare me or something?!";
"5e449";"Ohhh, you almost had me
there for a minute!";
"5e47b";"But you look kinda weak. Demons
should be more ferocious-looking--
like Keith!";
"5e4d1";"You know, that's actually
pretty cool.";
"5e4ff";"Heheh... Good luck, Mister
Adol! I'm counting on you!";
"5e53b";"If we go through the hole Keith
made, we should come out near the
Colony of Lava, where I live.";
"5e5a1";"Maybe YOU can breathe poison without
dying a horrible death, but I sure
can't! So let's NOT go that way!";
"5e611";"That passageway is
full of poison gas.";
"5e63f";"Guess you missed out. You
only got to see him from
the back.";

BE SURE, BE SURE!";
"5e6a9";"HE NOT IN WATER

"5e8db";"Ack! A demon! We're doooooooooooomed!
...Oh, wait. False alarm. It's Keith.";
"5e92d";"Adol, this is the man who
helped us in the bell tower.";
"5e96b";"...";
"5e975";"Take care. I'm
going on ahead.";
"5e99b";"It's a Wing!";
"5e9af";"We can use that to get
everyone safely back to
the village!";
"5e9f1";"All right! We can go home!";
"5ea13";"You're a real lifesaver. Don't worry,
we won't get in your way. We're going
to head back to the village.";
"5ea83";"Thank you so much, Adol.
If only Lilia were here,
things would be perfect!";
"5ead5";"#c2#Adol swore that he
would find Lilia.";
"5eb05";"We'd never entered it before... but it
seemed like we were being guided there,
somehow. So we left ourselves to fate.";
"5eb81";"I think the area where I got it is
called...I want to say, the Sacred
District of Toal? Something like that.";
"5ebf5";"I found it in the old, abandoned
Rasteenie Mine. No clue what it
was doing down there.";
"5ec53";"Understood. I'll leave her up to
you, then. ...Oh, that reminds me!
I picked this up before I was captured.";
"5ecc5";"You may need it in your battles,
Adol. You should take it with you.";
"5ed0f";"Anyway, I'll see you later, Adol.
You can do this... I know you can!
I believe in you!";
"5ed6d";"Oh no! It's a demon! Have
we been found?!";
"5ed9d";"But that aside...we're saved!
You did it! You saved us all!
I knew you'd pull through!";
"5edfb";"I work with stone for a living, and let
me tell you, getting turned into it is a
much less rewarding experience!";
"5ee73";"Hoooooooooaaaaaaaaaah!
Air! Delicious air!";
"5eea5";"Air! In my lungs! ...Words...fail...
Should've...sent a poet...";
"5eeeb";"*hooooooooohhhh*
*haaaaaahhhhhh*";
"5ef13";"Now, don't be too surprised,
but Lilia's here, too.";
"5ef4d";"I was captured by demons in
Rasteenie, and...well...you
know the rest, I suppose!";
"5efa5";"It's me, Bohtz, the
miner from Lance!";
"5efd1";"Well, now, this is a surprise.
If it isn't Adol Christin!";
"5f011";"Pretty smooth, lover boy. You work fast!
You should go see her, and get what's
comin' to you!";
"5f075";"She escaped here with the rest of us,
and she simply won't shut up about you!
I do believe she's smitten...";
"5f0e7";"Well, well... It's a Roo!
Now I KNOW we'll be okay!";
"5f121";"From what I overheard, the demons are
coming from the Ys Core, which is even
deeper underground than the canal.";
"5f197";"I was keeping my ears open while
we were being taken away.";
"5f1d9";"I doubt you'd remember me.
I'm Noit, from the Colony
of Lava.";
"5f21d";"Hey, aren't you Adol?";
"5f239";"But if you touch a Goddess statue with
something once owned by the Goddesses,
you'll go where you need to be.";
"5f2ad";"Seems that the passage leading to
the Goddesses' Palace has been sealed
off in some peculiar manner.";
"5f319";"A demon named Keith
told me something
before we came here.";
"5f35b";"Gyaaargh!";
"5f36b";"Could it be...?
Is Ys...returning
to the surface...?";
"5f3a7";"When I was being held in the bell tower,
I looked outside and realized I could
see the world below.";
"5f411";"We got away from the demons easily
enough, but Maria was captured. If
we don't hurry, she'll be sacrificed!";
"5f483";"Goddesses! Saaaaaave me!";
"5f4a3";"Aiieeeeeee!";
"5f4b5";"May the Goddesses keep her
safe, and deliver her back
into our care...";
"5f503";"This place is teeming with
demons... It's not safe for
her to be here alone!";
"5f557";"When I came to, Lilia was
gone. I wonder where she
could have gotten off to?";
"5f5ab";"Silly, huh? Probably
just my imagination!";
"5f5db";"The weirdest part, though...is that a
friend of mine died a while ago, and
that demon...reminded me of him...";
"5f64f";"Strangest thing I've ever seen...
A green demon came and rescued us!";
"5f69b";"Wasn't anyone
keeping watch?!";
"5f6bf";"Aieee! We've been breached!
There's a demon in here!";
"5f6fb";"I would wager that he's
been changed back as well.";
"5f735";"Well, he said someone else in the
Shrine was also turned to stone,
just as we were.";
"5f78f";"That friendly demon named
Keith told me...";
"5f7c1";"Thank you for saving us.";
"5f7e1";"Everyone who escaped from the demons is
hiding here. We can't stay here forever,

the village, when some demons on the
hunt came out of nowhere...";

good use of it, Adol.";

key and said to pass it on to you. It's

somewhere around here, but I can't
remember where! What should I do?";

got some good advice for you.";

give Maria back to me!";

give the good news to Karen and
Sada, as well.";

for telling me!";

no idea what a relief that is.
Praises be to the Goddesses!";

but now they're so high above...";

Oh, Maria...";

the entrance to the Shrine, anyway,
so I'd never even get in!";

but someone like me wouldn't
last two minutes in there!";

was captured by demons, and taken
away for sacrifice.";

Please, give me a break here!";
"6290d";"My daughter and I both will pray
for your victory and safe return.";

continue doing what I've been doing.
It's all I CAN do, really...";

for your victory and safe return.";

was able to see my daughter again.
I can never thank you enough.";

for your victory and safe return.";

was able to see my daughter again.

What you did beneath the Shrine
was a tremendous display of heroism.";

fine. Surely, the Goddesses smile
upon us, no?";

Is this the will of the Goddesses?";

be with you in your travels.";

behind us, once and for all.";

Maria and Lilia are well.";

for letting me know.";

behind us, once and for all.";

as well, you say?";

safely home, as well...";
"62e67";"We were very fortunate. No
doubt the Goddesses were
watching over us.";
"62eb3";"It is to you and that green demon that
we owe our thanks. Without you both, we
would never have seen Ramia again.";

Sooooooooomeboooooooody!";
"62f67";"Looking over the cliff edge, with the
world below getting closer and closer...
It was genuinely frightening!";

strange the sky looks? It's because Ys
has passed through the clouds!";

see Ramia Village again.";

in the hideout beneath the Shrine.";

digging my grave right now,
at this rate...)";

And unharmed?!";

to hear that Maria is safe. So
absolutely wonderful!";
63213;"I can't even imagine the look on his
face when he finds out!";

then go do it! He's probably
still in the graveyard.";

effort...but I can't think of anyone
who'll be happier to hear it!";

Maria...crying the whole time...";

loved them...so as long they bloom here,
I think that means she's happy...";
"633f9";"She's the only one who's left us
earthly remains to bury. I wonder
if she's lonely down there...";
63461;"All of these gravesites are empty;
they're essentially just memorials.
Except for Marle's, anyway...";
"634cd";"We've lost so many in the
last six months...";
63501;"None of the bodies have ever been
recovered, but we couldn't just
leave it at that, you know?";
63565;"These are the graves of all
those who were sacrificed...";
"635a5";"If you try it, I'll use my
super-powerful magic on you!";
"635e3";"I won't let you lay a hand
on my Frau, ja?";
63615;"You want me to fight by
your side, too? I'll do it!
I really will!";
"6365f";"We've got a whole new world to
explore out there, and I dunno
WHAT could be waiting for me there!";
"636c7";"Mister Adol! You gotta
teach me some magic!";
"636f9";"I'd bet good money that he was
a demon dressed up like a human.";
"6373f";"Some suspicious-looking guy
just went through the gate.";
"6377d";"You gotta teach me some spells
sometime! Pleeeeeease?";
"637b9";"Mister Adol... Are you
really a magician?!";
"637eb";"Heh. I just heard
some real juicy
gossip from Gorto.";
63827;"It can get pretty rough around
here, so be careful, okay?";
63867;"Mister Adol, are you goin' off
on an adventure?";
"6389d";"Hey mister, I've never seen you
before. What's your name? Mine's
Faye. Kinda girly, I know!";

here, so be careful, okay?";

You goin' off on an adventure,
Mister Adol?";

"639df";"Are you still all by yourself?";
"63a05";"*sniffle* I'm soooo loooonely...";
"63a2d";"Are you all by yourself,
like me?";
"63a55";"If you see them, can you ask them
to protect everyone for me, please?";
"63aa1";"Did you get to meet the
Goddesses, then, mister?";
"63ad9";"You're from the world below, right?
My daddy told me so.";
"63b19";"Daddy says that you're doin'
somethin' for the Goddesses.
That's why I'm thanking you.";
"63b77";"Heh. Thanks, mister.";
"63b93";"So I'll bet he's gonna show
up any time now!";
"63bc7";"I've been prayin' to the
Goddesses to bring him
back home ever since.";
"63c13";"Daddy's gone missing...";
"63c31";"*sniffle* Daddy...";
"63c4b";"I've looked everywhere,
but I can't find him!";

did you go?";

You must be Adol.";
"63cc9";"I believe you have the strength
to end this. Fight the good fight,
Adol Christin!";

victory and safe return.";

to end this. Fight the good fight,
Adol Christin!";

victory and safe return. And
Maria's, as well...";
"63e0d";"If you haven't done so already,
you really should go and tell
Maria's mother the good news, too.";
"63e75";"But I never truly believed I'd actually
be ABLE to come to terms with it. And
now...I don't have to. Thanks to you.";
"63eef";"In my grief, I thought that digging
her gravesite was the only way I'd
ever come to terms with what happened...";
"63f65";"Almighty Goddesses... Thank you
so much for your blessings! And
Adol, you too, of course...";
"63fc7";"Wait... Maria is safe?
Truly?!";
"63fed";"I'm going to rescue Maria, even
if I have to take down every last
demon to do so.";
64045;"Open the gate, Gorto.";
64061;"You need to calm down, and wait for the
right chance. Jump in without thinking,
and you'll just get yourself killed!";
"640dd";"Sada, look... I understand your
feelings, I really do...but let's
not do anything rash, okay?";
64141;"If I do that, Maria's going to DIE!
And I'm sorry, but I just can't let
that happen!";
"6419d";"So you want me to just sit around
in the vain hope that a perfect
opportunity comes along?!";
"641ff";"I know all that. I do understand the
gravity of the situation! And I feel
exactly the same way you do.";
"6426d";"Maria is my life. There's not going to
BE a perfect opportunity. It's now or
never, and never's not an option!";
"642e3";"Then why are you standing
in my way?!";
"6430f";"Sada...";
"6431d";"STAND ASIDE, GORTO!";
64337;"I'm sorry...but I can't
just let Maria die. I hope
you understand.";
64381;"Sada... You...";
64397;"Make sure this gate
stays shut!";
"643bd";"Wait... Adol...? What's with the cutesy
costume? You look like a demon! Stay
like that and you'll get attacked!";
64433;"A demon...?!";
64447;"You really do look
just like a Roo.";
64471;"That's some pretty
impressive magic.";
"6449d";"How the heck did you
turn yourself into a
Roo?!";
"644d3";"...Wait a second...
Is that you, Adol?!";
64501;"Agggh!";
"6450f";"Oh... It's just a Roo.
Don't scare people like
that, little fella!";
64559;"Agggh!";
64567;"The other villagers and I want to
extend our gratitude to you, though,
nonetheless. Stand firm, adventurer!";
"645d9";"Sada is alive and well,
but Maria...was not so
fortunate...";
"6461b";"Glad you found the
Black Pearl!";
64641;"Glad you found the
Black Pearl!";
64667;"The #c2#Black Pearl#c#...?";
64689;"It's kinda weird... I only took my eyes
off of him for a second, and suddenly,
he was gone!";
"646eb";"The question is, where did he go with
it...?";
"6471f";"I'll bet that was it!";
"6473b";"I saw a man in a #c2#black cloak#c# bend down
and pick up a pebble or something a
little while ago...";
"647a7";"If he was a demon, maybe he could
teleport or something. So it might
be somewhere secure in the Shrine...";
64817;"It's kinda weird... I only took
my eyes off of him for a second,
and suddenly, he was gone!";
64879;"I'll bet it was the Black Pearl!
The question is, where did he go
with it?";
"648cb";"I saw a man in a #c2#black cloak#c# bend
down and pick up a pebble or
something a little while ago...";
64937;"Could it be that Ys is returning
to the surface...? That couldn't
possibly be it...right?";
64997;"The weather has been getting much
warmer, lately...far, FAR warmer
than ever before.";
"649f3";"You know, I've been thinking...";
"64a19";"Must be pretty brave, though,
to have come all the way from
the Lava Colony by himself.";
"64a77";"Hey, Adol. You seen that kid
around here? He's a bit of a
troublemaker...";
"64ac7";"Those two girls in my dream told me to
help you, but even if they hadn't, I get
this weird feeling I'd do it anyway...";
"64b45";"If you have any problems,
Adol, you be sure to let me
know about 'em!";
"64b91";"All right, gimme a sec.
I'll open the gate.";
"64bc3";"You can use that to bug Hadat from
anywhere in Ys, right? Pretty handy
little artifact to have on hand!";
"64c31";"Oh-ho, so Hadat gave you
the #c2#Lila Shell#c#, did he?";
"64c6f";"That's as far as you go. Gotta
wait for the full version before
I'll let you go any farther.";
"64cd3";"Well, there you are, then.
Take care, Adol!";
"64d05";"He lives in the wooden house
all the way at the bottom of
the stairs here.";
"64d57";"First and foremost, you should
go and see #c2#Hadat#c#.";
"64d95";"So you're...? Hmmm...
Interesting...";
"64dc1";"I hate to be a bother, but I really need
to get your take on something. Can you
spare a moment?";
"64e27";"My name is Gorto.";
"64e3f";"...And here you are!";
"64e5b";"They said they wanted me to offer him my
help.";
"64e91";"In it, there were these two girls who
told me a red-haired swordsman would
soon be arriving in the village.";

dream.";

that had led him to Solomon Shrine.";

monster or something, you've run up
against a brick wall.";

kindly to humans passing through.";
"6503d";"...there's still another gate beyond,
guarded by demons. You'll need to get
past them to get into Solomon Shrine.";
"650b5";"I see. But even if I let you through
this gate...";

65119;"There's a friend of mine... Sada. He
went in recently. I tried to stop him,
but I couldn't.";
"6517b";"You may be strong, but I don't think
you'll be able to infiltrate the Shrine
without a bit of forethought.";
"651ed";"I guess the best thing I could do to
help you would be to open this gate...
but I'm a little afraid to...";
"6525d";"But Solomon Shrine is many times larger
than this village, and the layout is
about as labyrinthine as it gets.";
"652d3";"Knowing him as well as I do,
I expect he'll give the demons
a run for their money...";
"6532f";"He's got a good head on his shoulders.
He'll be able to help you cook up a
plan of attack, for sure!";
"6539b";"Hmmm... Before you head into the
Shrine, you should go ask #c2#Hadat#c#
for some assistance.";

"66f4d";"...Well, if all you do is push on,
I suppose you'll just wear yourself
out. So...stay as long as you'd like.";
"66fc1";"I tried to stop him, being his father
and all...but he's a pretty obstinate
one. Kinda reminds me of someone else...";
"6703d";"That man in the black cloak showed up
earlier, and Tarf went after him, to
find out what he's after.";
"670a9";"Hey, Adol. Have you seen Tarf?";
"670cf";"He kept bugging me to give it
a shot, so I finally agreed.
Never seen him so excited!";
"6712b";"Tarf's on bridge duty!";
67149;"Hey, Adol. Did you see?
My little boy is growing up!";
67185;"Tarf is inside. Feel free to have
him prepare a bed for you. You can
stay with us as long as you'd like!";
"671f5";"What's wrong, Adol? You
look like you seriously
need a vacation!";
"6723d";"I'm so sorry for snubbing
you, Adol. You're a true
hero!";
"6727d";"...What?! You lost
sight of him?!";
"672a5";"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times
thank you! So...where is he? Did he
go back home already?";
"6730d";"For true?!";
"6731f";"...You found Tarf?";
67339;"Would you...you know, GO GET HIM?!
Honestly, I can't believe you'd start
escorting a little boy, then run off!";
"673af";"He's probably waiting wherever
he lost sight of you.";
"673eb";"I've always taught him that if he's
ever alone and there are no adults
around, he should just stay put.";
67459;"...You found Tarf?";
67473;"Adol told Ruba that he
had rescued Tarf.";
"674a3";"...What?! You just...
left him?!";
"674cb";"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times
thank you! So...where is he? Did he
go back home already?";
67533;"For true?!";
67545;"Please, go back and get him!";
67569;"...Adol, there's no way a boy his age
could make it back home all on his own.
Not with all the demons out there!";
"675e1";"I'm counting on you, Adol.
Please, find Tarf for me.";
"6761d";"I'll keep up the act and report
that I didn't let you pass.";
"6765f";"Why not try asking
them about Tarf?";
67689;"If you were to transform into a Roo,
I'll bet you'd be able to understand
what the demons are saying.";
"676f5";"#c2#Adol told the bridge guard
he knew about his son being
kidnapped by the man in black.";
67755;"...It all started
two days ago.";
"6777b";"I see...so you know
everything, then.";
"677a7";"Wait...so that Roo was...?";
"677c9";"For the time being, there's no
way to repair it, either. You
won't be able to get across.";
67829;"I'm sorry...but the bridge's
winch was broken by some
demons. It won't go down.";
"6787f";"I'm Ruba, the bridge
guard. And you are?";
"678af";"...";
"678b9";"Hmm... A redhead...";
"678d3";"#c2#Adol told the man his name.";
"678f9";"For the time being, there's no
way to repair it, either. You
won't be able to get across.";
67959;"I'm sorry, but the bridge's
winch was broken by some
demons. It won't go down.";
"679af";"I see...so you're Adol.";
"679cd";"T-Tarf!";
"679db";"Daaad!";
"679e9";"Just do as you're told, and your
son will be returned unharmed.";
"67a2f";"Do not let him cross the bridge.";
"67a57";"...A red-haired swordsman by
the name of Adol will be
coming through here soon.";
"67aad";"Tarf...!";
"67abd";"You must have noticed how the villagers
have been regarding you, no? It's
because they all know what happened.";
"67b33";"...So Tarf was taken, and those
were the instructions for ensuring
his safe return.";
"67b8d";"Awww, how cute. It's a Roo!";
"67baf";"But then again, what do I know?";
"67bd5";"I don't know, though...
You don't LOOK like a hero...";
"67c11";"Flonne has been saying you're
some kind of hero.";
"67c49";"...Thank you. You're
a fine young man.";
"67c77";"So, you managed to rescue Noit,
did you? I guess I didn't give
you enough credit.";
"67ccf";"We can hear the ringing from Solomon
Shrine's bell tower all the way here.";
"67d21";"Noit's disappeared.
Hadn't you heard?";
"67d4d";"Though I guess it's kind of your fault
he was taken in the first place, but
still...you didn't do anything wrong.";
"67dc5";"I hear you rescued Tarf.";
"67de5";"I'm busy right now.
You're in my way,
so go on, shoo!";
"67e21";"What're you looking at?";
"67e3f";"Are you the one...?";
"67e59";"Oh... Oh, my...";
"67e6f";"Just a Roo... Just a Roo...
Just waaaalk on by...";
"67ea7";"Oh... Oh, my...";
"67ebd";"...It's a Roo. Nothing to
worry about...";
"67eed";"...Or are you looking for Ruba? If so,
you'll find him at his house. Should be
there 'til his shift starts.";
"67f5f";"How do you like my work?
Want to be my protege?";
"67f95";"Truth be told, I've been the
bridge guard for 36 years now.";
"67fd7";"If you keep your wits about you, any
and all problems you encounter can be
resolved with little effort.";
68045;"Just clear your mind, and gaze upon
your surroundings. In no time at all,
your next move will become clear!";
"680b7";"Greetings, little one. You seem
unsettled... What is it that
troubles you so?";
"6810b";"Outspoken, she is. But she
means well, and is really a
very sweet girl.";
68159;"You should have seen her face when I
told her what you did. She was beaming
from ear to ear!";
"681bd";"Thank you for saving Tarf. Elle may not
have said anything...but that's just her
way. She's grateful as well, to be sure.";
"6823d";"Y...you're...!";
68253;"Hmm? Ah, a Roo. How unusual!";
68277;"It could be the end of days for us all.
I should watch the events unfold from
the Ice Ridge of Noltia.";
"682e5";"If so, then we must be getting close
now. I wonder what the moment of
impact will be like...";
68349;"...And I swear, it looked as if Ys
were descending to the surface...";
68395;"You know, when I was locked up in
the bell tower, all I could do was
gaze at the sky outside my window.";
68403;"I know I should have tried to run,
but I just couldn't bring myself to
leave the safety of that room...";
68471;"If not for you, there's
no telling what might've
happened to me!";
"684b9";"I know I should have tried to run,
but I just couldn't bring myself to
leave the safety of that room...";
68527;"If not for you, there's
no telling what might've
happened to me.";
"6856f";"Man, thank you so much. Can't
believe I made it back here in
one piece!";
"685bd";"Soothes the fire within,
you know?";
"685e7";"I think that I might go to the
Ice Ridge to cool off for a bit.";
"6862d";"That's the problem with living
in a lava pit underground: no
weather. And it's soooooo hot!";
"6868f";"Probably somewhere isolated, away
from the prying eyes of demons...";
"686d9";"As a result, they all scattered off,
going into hiding somewhere. I wonder
where they've gone?";
"6873f";"But they were cursed by the demons,
changing their appearance forever. Now,
people often mistake them for demons.";
"687b7";"Roos used to be sacred creatures
in the Goddesses' service.";
"687f9";"They're such cute little things--
curse or no. Wonder where they
all went...?";
"6884d";"As such, we almost never see
the Roos anymore...the 'Divine
Messengers,' if you will.";
"688a9";"This area's swarming
with demons, too.";
"688d7";"Yaaagh! Saaaaave meeee!";
"688f5";"Apparently, they want to see
for themselves if Ys has truly
fallen back to the surface.";
68953;"Noit and my husband are
talking about going off
somewhere again. *sigh*";
"689a1";"So when something bad happens to Noit,
it's like something bad happening to a
member of the family.";
"68a0b";"My husband is a good
friend of his, you see.";
"68a3f";"I'm so glad Noit's been
returned to us, safe and
sound!";
"68a7d";"Isn't this a crazy place? Cold
outside, hot inside... Be careful
you don't get yourself sick!";
"68ae1";"Ah, so you've been to Ramia
Village, have you?";
"68b17";"I know you've been put through
the wringer here, but just...
persevere. You shall be victorious.";
"68b7f";"You don't seem like such
a bad guy after all...";
"68bb5";"I really don't know if there's
anything we can do to stand up
to the demons...";
"68c0b";"If your cause is just, then I'm
certain the Goddesses will
protect and bless you.";
"68c63";"Red hair...";
"68c75";"I've heard that Roos aren't
actually demons at all...";
"68cb1";"...But, I mean, they're inhuman
creatures with human-like intelli-
gence. Isn't that...a demon?";
"68d17";"Putting himself in that kind of
danger, in these demon-infested
environs? What a buffoon...";
"68d79";"Noit just HAS to see with his
own eyes if Ys is really falling
back to the surface of the world.";
"68de1";"...I guess that's why I couldn't
find him at the Ice Ridge!";
"68e23";"Noit says he was captured, and
that the demons tossed him into
a cell in Solomon Shrine.";
"68e83";"I'm afraid the demons
may've gotten him...";
"68eb5";"I went to the Ice Ridge to look
for him, but he was nowhere to
be found. Not a trace of him!";
"68f19";"Eventually, he buckled down and did
it...and that was the last anyone's
seen of him!";
"68f75";"Noit is obsessed with cooling himself
down. He kept saying he should take a
walk along the Ice Ridge of Noltia...";
"68fed";"If true, then I can't help but feel
sorry for them. They shouldn't be
called demons at all.";
"6904f";"They were cursed long ago,
to look like monsters...but
they're very gentle creatures.";
"690ab";"Noit was just telling me that the
Roos were once sacred animals.";
"690f3";"I guess I AM being watched
when I'm there!";
69125;"...Oh, there are Roos
hiding around there?
Well, that explains it!";
"6916f";"Anytime I go near that Goddess statue
at the entrance to the Ice Ridge, I
get the feeling I'm being watched...";
"691e5";"Gotta be something, though!
I wonder if there's some way
to lure it out...";
69237;"It's like there are demons
watching me...but it doesn't
really feel demonic.";
"6928b";"Anytime I go near that Goddess statue
at the entrance to the Ice Ridge, I
get the feeling I'm being watched...";
69301;"I wonder if there's some way
to lure it out...";
69337;"Gotta be something, though!";
69359;"It was like there were demons
watching me...but it didn't
really feel demonic.";
"693af";"As I drew near it, I could swear
someone was watching me...";
"693f1";"And you've seen that Goddess
statue there, right?";
69429;"Very odd. I was just at the entrance
to the Ice Ridge of Noltia, to cool
myself off...";
69487;"...Crono, was it?";
"6949f";"Wait... Don't tell me...
Man, I'm so bad at remembering
names...";
"694e7";"...Ha! I'll take your silence
as a modest yes. Good for you!
Go get 'em, slugger!";
"6953f";"You're the hero the Goddesses
foretold, aren't you?";
69579;"I've been mulling this over,
ever since you rescued Tarf...";
"695bb";"He says you're the one who rescued
him from his prison, after he was
captured by demons.";
"6961b";"Noit was missing for a good
long while, but he's finally
come back home.";
"6966b";"There's not a doubt in my mind that
everyone in the village wishes you
only the very best. Courage, Adol!";
"696db";"If you ever need a friendly ear, too,
I'll be happy to lend you mind. Drop
on by anytime you'd like!";
69747;"You should take a break from this hero
role of yours, every now and again.
You'll wear yourself out, if you don't!";
"697c1";"You look awfully thin...
Have you not been eating well?";
"697ff";"Oh, my, it certainly has
been a while.";
"6982d";"I'm so sorry to have given
you the cold shoulder before.";
"6986d";"I heard the news from Elle.";
"6988f";"You're the fellow who rescued Tarf
from the demons, are you not?";
"698d7";"As am I. Thank you so much
for saving our little menace.";
69917;"She didn't want me to say anything
to you...but she was actually really
impressed by your actions.";
69981;"I heard all about it from
his cousin, Elle.";
"699b3";"So, you really did rescue Tarf...";
"699db";"Really...?";
"699ed";"...Eh? You're going to
go rescue Tarf?";
"69a1b";"Please...save Tarf.
For his sake, and
for Ruba's.";
"69a53";"I c-can't talk to you right now.
Please, forgive me...";
"69a91";"Er, um...uh, sorry.";
"69aab";"Y-You're...!";
"69abf";"Demon? Pfah! I spit in the
faces of demons! Spit, spit!";
"69afd";"I knew you had it in you, mister.
Man, I wanna go on an adventure
of my own someday!";
"69b59";"Did you really rescue old Noit
from the demons' lair?";
"69b95";"Heh...I heard a rumor
about you, mister.";
"69bc5";"I knew I should've gone to
Ramia Village with Tarf.";
"69bff";"*sigh*";
"69c0d";"When I grow up, I wanna go
and have adventures, too!";
"69c49";"Boy, you sure are lucky, mister.";
"69c71";"When I'm grown up, I'm gonna be
just like you and make the village
safe from demons!";
"69ccd";"When I'm grown up, I'm gonna be
just like you and make the village
safe from demons!";
"69d29";"Thanks for rescuing Tarf.";
"69d49";"I...uh...I'm really sorry I
said you were an outsider.";
"69d87";"...Outsider.";
"69d9b";"...";
"69da5";"I'm dead. See? Dead!
So don't talk to me!";
"69dd5";"Noit made it back to the
village. He says you were
the one who rescued him.";
"69e27";"I could stand to learn
by your example.";
"69e55";"Glad he's finally got a good male role
model. Me, I've always been so busy and
haughty, he basically hates me!";
"69ecb";"You're quite a guy. My son
practically worships the
ground you walk on.";
"69f19";"Even with all the danger, he still
wanders around like he owns the
place. Makes me so worried!";
"69f7f";"If Ischt got captured too...I just
don't know how I would handle it!";
"69fcb";"No sooner had I been thinking about
Tarf's safe return, than Noit does a
disappearing act of his own!";
"6a037";"...So you actually saved Tarf.";
"6a05d";"...So you really did rescue Tarf.";
"6a085";"Still, it's because of you that he got
kidnapped in the first place. So aren't
we still in danger, with you around?";
"6a0ff";"I hear if you play dead when the demons
come around, they'll leave you be.
Sounds pretty far-fetched, though.";
"6a173";"Wh-what if... What would I do if
MY son were to be taken away?!";
"6a1b9";"Do you really intend
to rescue Tarf?";
"6a1e5";"...I heard you talking
with Ruba.";
"6a20d";"Tarf... I'll pray for your
safety, every day...";
"6a243";"...Staring? I wasn't
staring...";
"6a269";"...!";
"6a275";"You're that skinny fella, Crono,
aren't you? Lived next door to me
20 years ago?";
"6a2cd";"Can it really be you?
It's been a long time!";
"6a301";"Oh, my my my!";
"6a315";"Were you training so you could protect
me? Such a manly man, you are!";
"6a361";"Haven't seen you for a long time...
but here you are! And you've grown
some serious muscles...";
"6a3c7";"Huh...";
"6a3d5";"If I were only ten years
younger, you wouldn't be
able to get rid of me!";
"6a425";"I go a little while without seeing you,
and you get all grown up on me!";
"6a473";"Huh...";
"6a481";"If you don't...well, I might
just have to club you and take
back to my cave! Ohh ho-ho-ho!";
"6a4e3";"If you go now, you might
just make it...";
"6a513";"When did that snot-nosed kid I
once knew grow up into such a
fine, upstanding adult...?";
"6a571";"You've certainly grown since
last I saw you.";
"6a5a5";"Oh, my my my!";
"6a5b9";"Come on, you don't have to be so
shy! But, I suppose you always were
a timid child...";
"6a615";"...Eh? I've mistaken you
for someone else, you say?";
"6a64f";"A red-haired...young man...";
"6a671";"You've already saved Tarf.
So I guess we don't have to
drive you away anymore!";
"6a6c7";"...Eh?";
"6a6d5";"Your head's so red... Is that
natural, or is that the blood
of your enemies...?";
"6a72b";"You...!";
"6a739";"I think it was Ruba...
Something about Tarf...
Oh, I just can't remember!";
"6a789";"...Actually, come to think of it,
didn't somebody say something about
a redhead just recently...?";
"6a7f1";"That's your natural hair
color? Seriously?!";
"6a823";"G-g-good day to you.";
"6a83f";"I wonder what had them
so spooked...?";
"6a86b";"The pikkards were making a
lot of noise until just a
short while ago.";
"6a8b7";"Probably got lost while he was out
walking, and wandered into their
territory or something...";
"6a91b";"What the heck did the demons
want with ol' Noit, though?!";
"6a95b";"The consummate hero, that's what
you are. Such an amazing lad!";
"6a9a1";"Haven't seen you in a while...
Oh? You rescued Noit, did you?";
"6a9e5";"You're looking well! ...And
speaking of wellness, where'd
Noit get himself off to?!";
"6aa3f";"There are demons all over creation,
and he decides to go take a walk?
What the hell was he thinking?!";
"6aaab";"I swear, that man's brain moves at
inhuman speeds, but his common sense
moves at SUBhuman speeds!";
"6ab13";"We can't let the demons run roughshod
over us anymore. We're going to show
them that we can protect our own!";
"6ab87";"We can't let the demons run roughshod
over us anymore. We're going to show
them that we can protect our own!";
"6abfb";"But, I mean, if you weren't such
a threat to them, Tarf would have
never been taken...you know?";
"6ac61";"...I'm really sorry. I know
that all of this is the demons'
fault, NOT yours.";
"6acb5";"...I-I'm not here right now.
Leave a message, and I'll get
back to you...";
"6ad05";"Never venture outside alone. The demons'
numbers have been increasing lately. And
keep watch over your children!";
"6ad7d";"Never venture outside alone. The demons'
numbers have been increasing lately. And
keep watch over your children!";
"6adf5";"Casa de Ruba
and Tarf";
"6ae11";"Fred and Natalie's
Humble Abode";
"6ae37";"Home of
Noit and Rafa";
"6ae53";"Chelnie and
Rex's House";
"6ae71";"Tarf!";
"6ae7d";"Thank goodness... Tarf,
you're not hurt? You're
all right?!";
"6aebf";"I AM kinda hungry, though...";
"6aee3";"I'm fine. No big deal at all!
Not like I'm scared of the
demons even one little bit.";
"6af3f";"I see. Well, let's
get some food into
you, then!";
"6af77";"Okay!";
"6af83";"I'm so sorry for what
I said to you before.";
"6afb5";"As for you... I don't know
how I can ever thank you.";
"6aff5";"I could've been left to
starve. And man, that would
be the worst fate of all!";
"6b04d";"If not for Mister Adol,
I don't know what would've
happened to me.";
"6b097";"Well, this has been a real eye-opener
for me. We can't allow the demons to
keep doing things like this.";
"6b105";"Heh.";
"6b111";"Time to lower that bridge!";
"6b133";"You show 'em, Dad!
Fight the machine!";
"6b15f";"You have someplace to be,
no? I'll lower the bridge
for you right away!";
"6b1ad";"You all set to go?";
"6b1c7";"Keep them. They may yet
serve you in your journey.";
"6b201";"Oh, the #c2#Whisper Earrings#c#?";
"6b229";"There we have it.";
"6b241";"Off you go, then!";
"6b259";"Pikkard";
"6b267";"Pikkard";
"6b275";"Pikkard";
"6b283";"Pikkard";
"6b291";"Pikkard";
"6b29f";"I will imbue your blade with the
concentrated power of the land
of Ys.";
"6b2ed";"Adol... Please, be safe...";
"6b30f";"I'm sorry for not telling you the truth
before...that I am actually one of the
twin Goddesses of Ys.";
"6b37b";"It's me, Feena.";
"6b391";"Oh, Adol. I've been hoping I would see
you again...";
"6b3cb";"If magic itself is not eradicated,
this land will never know true peace.";
"6b41b";"Using magic to seal away the demons
guaranteed that the seal would,
eventually, be broken...";
"6b47f";"Beyond this portal lies a giant, Black
Pearl, which is the true source of all
magic in Ys. That is the demons' secret.";
"6b4fd";"If magic itself is not eradicated,
this land will never know true peace.";
"6b54d";"Using magic to seal away the demons
guaranteed that the seal would,
eventually, be broken...";
"6b5b1";"Beyond this portal lies a giant, Black
Pearl, which is the true source of all
magic in Ys. That is the demons' secret.";
"6b62f";"The Goddesses seem held in place, as if
by an unfathomably powerful energy.";
"6b681";"This is to be the final battle.";
"6b6a7";"Adol, you have done well in getting this
far. I am Reah, Goddess of Ys.";
"6b6f5";"You must somehow destroy the Black
Pearl. Please, wear my #c2#ring#c# during
the fight. It will weaken the demon.";
"6b76d";"We need the might of a swordsman to aid
us in this, our darkest hour...";
"6b7bb";"We do not have the strength to re-seal
the demons on our own, I'm afraid...";
"6b80d";"Because of the magic this released,
Dark Fact was able to gain the edge
he needed to break the seal.";
"6b879";"Hundreds of years passed in tranquility
until the day Cleria was excavated,
misidentified as silver...";
"6b8e7";"The Cleria was born of the demons, you
see-- and of the magic-- and we deemed
its presence a hazard.";
"6b953";"When the demons were wiped out, we were
the ones who buried the Cleria deep
within the ground.";
"6b9b9";"The Goddesses seem held in place, as if
by an unfathomably powerful energy.";
"6ba0b";"Adol, this really isn't the time
to play Happy Animal Buddies...";
"6ba53";"Everything hinges upon you, my friend.
Do not falter!";
"6ba8f";"This is the final battle.";
"6baaf";"Its sound will remove the
curse on the Goddesses.";
"6bae7";"Quickly, play the
#c2#Silver Harmonica#c#.";
"6bb19";"Not my turn yet.";
"6bb31";"I doubt you'll fool anyone with that
Roo form of yours anymore.";
"6bb77";"Nice try, Adol, but the hair's
a dead giveaway.";
"6bbad";"I brought you the #c2#Cleria Shield#c#. I think
you'll need it in the coming fight.";
"6bc07";"It's me, Luta Gemma!";
"6bc23";"Adol, where've you been?";
"6bc43";"This is to be the last battle between
demon and human. Peace is within our
grasp!";
"6bc9b";"Adol, hurry up and play
the Silver Harmonica!";
"6bccf";"First, we must break the
seal on the Goddesses.";
"6bd05";"Not my turn yet.";
"6bd21";"I don't think so, demon!";
"6bd41";"I'm sorry to be so late, Adol. Quickly,
play this #c2#Silver Harmonica#c#! Its sound
will remove the curse on the Goddesses.";
"6bdc5";"Ys is now back where it belongs. And the
Priests are in attendance! ...Or did you
forget that I'm a descendant of Tovah?";
"6be45";"#c2#It's sealed shut.";
"6be61";"What in the world...?";
"6be7d";"That's right, Tarf!";
"6be97";"That's exactly it!";
"6beb1";"Whoa, whoa whoa whoa!";
"6becd";"What is it? What's wrong?!";
"6beef";"Th-the demons...!";
"6bf07";"Get back!";
"6bf17";"Darm is drawing the demons
into himself to increase
his power!";
"6bf5d";"It must be...";
"6bf71";"Keith, look out!";
"6bf89";"Why are we all here...?";
"6bfa7";"Tarf...";
"6bfb5";"Keith...";
"6bfc5";"...Adol, we'll be rooting
for you. Knock 'em dead,
man! ...Literally, if you can!";
"6c01d";"So...";
"6c029";"We're here to
observe Adol's
fight.";
"6c053";"In light of that...we, too, must
stand and fight in our own way,
to lend him support!";
"6c0af";"Adol is marching alone
into a fearsome struggle.";
"6c0e7";"Mister Gorto...";
"6c0fd";"We may not be able to offer
direct assistance to Adol, but
that doesn't make us powerless...";
"6c161";"Pray for Ys...and for all the
world...to lend Adol strength.";
"6c1a5";"Let us pray for his success, then,
if we cannot fight by his side!";
"6c1ef";"And you...should offer your prayers
to the surface world...the world to
which Ys is being returned!";
"6c259";"...Okay!";
"6c269";"Yes, let us pray. We shall pray
as we never have before. We shall
pray for unequivocal victory.";
"6c2cf";"I'll pray for Adol to be granted the
knowledge and wisdom to overcome this
difficult trial!";
"6c331";"I will pray for the light
to illuminate the darkness
before him.";
"6c379";"...that his resolve shall never
waver, and his heart shall never
falter.";
"6c3c9";"I pray...";
"6c3d9";"I guess that just leaves me...";
"6c3ff";"I pray...that Adol's
sword be granted power
beyond power!";
"6c43f";"But there's something magical
about them that just fills me
with energy!";
"6c48f";"They grow all over
the field, so they're
not exactly rare...";
"6c4d3";"I love Marle Flowers.";
"6c4ef";"...That's about all we know on the
subject of Solomon Shrine, though,
here in Lance. It's a mystery to us!";
"6c561";"On that distant summit, in Solomon
Shrine, sits the Goddesses' Palace,
where they supposedly lived.";
"6c5cb";"We see it all the time
from the plains, but
we've never been there...";
"6c617";"I wonder what the area
around Solomon Shrine
is actually like...";
"6c65f";"Ah, Adol. Hello, there!";
"6c67d";"It's my absolute favorite spot.";
"6c6a3";"Isn't this a wonderful place?";
"6c6c7";"I mean, looking at Ys from this
vantage point, it just seems so
peaceful and inviting...";
"6c727";"I have to wonder where the
demons originated from.";
"6c761";"Adol, look there...
across the field.";
"6c78d";"And the building on top of the Ice
Ridge is Solomon Shrine, where the
Goddesses used to live.";
"6c7f1";"Do you see that frozen cliff?
That's the Ice Ridge of Noltia.";
"6c835";"I wonder what it's like...";
"6c857";"We've only ever seen it from
here... None of us have ever
actually gone there.";
"6c8ad";"...Well, I'm off to pick
flowers. Take care, Adol!";
"6c8e7";"Don't look, don't
touch, and stay
back!";
"6c915";"What's with you? You're
way too close for comfort!";
"6c94f";"One side! Comin' through!";
"6c96f";"Hey! I have the right of way
here, bub! Step aside!";
"6c9a9";"I'm fat because I'm lazy...";
"6c9cb";"Well you're certainly an
odd-lookin' one...";
"6c9fd";"If you have no business
here, then go away!";
"6ca2f";"Who really cares, though?
I mean, we're pretty much
invincible!";
"6ca75";"I hear there's an intruder
in the Shrine. Boss-man's
makin' a big fuss about it.";
"6cacd";"Supposedly, there's been an
intruder. You think it's a
human?";
"6cb11";"Go back to your post!";
"6cb2d";"Hey! What do you
think you're doing?!";
"6cb59";"No time to talk now.
Go about your business.";
"6cb8d";"...Have we met before?";
"6cbab";"Everybody else is making fun of
him, but I don't see what the big
deal is. Redhead guy's just strong!";
"6cc17";"Looks like Druegar got
taken out by that
redhead.";
"6cc4f";"Why, it's Lord Druegar's chamber!";
"6cc77";"What is this place, you ask?";
"6cc9b";"Haven't seen you around before.";
"6ccc1";"...Nice try. But I know who you are.";
"6cced";"I suggest that you take your leave...
quickly.";
"6cd23";"Opposing us in your human form would be
foolish, at best...";
"6cd65";"I should warn you, red-haired
swordsman...";
"6cd97";"I suggest that you take your leave...
quickly.";
"6cdcd";"Opposing us as you are would be foolish,
at best...";
"6ce07";"This is as far as you go, Adol
Christin...";
"6ce39";"...Fool.";
"6ce49";"So you reject my offer...? I
extend to you my good will,
and you would spit on me?";
"6cea3";"This form is most appropriate
for one who would so readily
dance at the Goddesses' whim.";
"6cf03";"May you live out your days as
that which you have struggled
against for so long...";
"6cf5d";"If you will take your leave,
I will forgive your trespass.";
"6cf9f";"Adol cannot enter the main building
of the Shrine without it.";
"6cfe3";"This information must not leave this
room: It's been transferred to the
west sector of the Subterranean Canal.";
"6d059";"Adol doesn't know that
the Goddesses' Pendant
has been moved.";
"6d09d";"This area was once under the juris-
diction of Priest Dabbie. How do I
know that? ...Because I'm awesome!";
"6d10d";"...Or so I've been told. But
really, who cares? Isn't that
ancient history at this point?";
"6d16d";"This area was supposedly once
under Priest Dabbie's
jurisdiction.";
"6d1b5";"Not even one such as Mistress
Zava is exempt from that rule.";
"6d1f9";"Heh... The weak are weeded
out, and their bodies become
food for the strong.";
"6d24d";"They're currently in conference,
discussing a plan to get rid of
the intruder.";
"6d2a3";"She's actually out at the moment.
She's in the northern reception
hall right now.";
"6d2fb";"...What? You have something
to report to her?";
"6d32f";"This is Mistress
Zava's bedroom.";
"6d35b";"Didn't I already give you the
pass? Quickly, get to the
northern reception hall!";
"6d3b7";"Anything to nip this problem
in the bud, you know?";
"6d3f5";"He is priority one right now,
after all, so any information
you can provide, we'll welcome.";
"6d45b";"...An urgent matter regarding Adol,
you say? Very well, then. I'll issue
you a pass to get through security.";
"6d4d3";"What's that? A report for Mistress Zava?
I'm afraid she's attending a conference
in the northern reception hall...";
"6d54d";"I'm not your enemy. It's okay
to talk to me in human form.";
"6d58f";"This is the entrance to the bell tower,
known as the Campanile of Lane. And the
sacrificial ritual is beginning.";
"6d607";"It's me, Keith.";
"6d61d";"You need to save that poor, innocent
girl in my place, Adol. Please.";
"6d669";"Zava is lying in wait at the entrance...
but I'm not strong enough to fight her.";
"6d6c1";"On the fifth toll, the girl, Maria, will
die.";
"6d6f5";"What to do, what to do...
Don't talk to me! You're
not helping!";
"6d73b";"Directions? I don't know...
Go ask someone else!";
"6d773";"#c2#Two guards could be heard
conversing outside.";
"6d7ab";"#c2#Two guards could be heard speaking
to one another in the language of
the demons.";
"6d807";"We've finally got the traitor, Keith,
cornered down below. It's just a matter
of time until we catch him, now...";
"6d87f";"You look mighty suspicious.
Almost like a human...";
"6d8b9";"...I don't like you.";
"6d8d5";"Ugh, this does NOT bode
well for ANY of us...";
"6d909";"You mean to tell me that
you've been chosen as a
Shrine guard? YOU?";
"6d953";"You kind of smell like
a human...";
"6d97b";"...I think, anyway. What
does fish smell like, again?";
"6d9b7";"You smell like fish.";
"6d9d3";"Huh? Aren't you...?";
"6d9ed";"Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?";
"6da19";"Who are you? Ain't seen
you 'round these parts
afore...";
"6da57";"This is no place for
outsiders. Get lost!";
"6da87";"You're just a little pup! What
is this effort coming to, if we
need to start hiring children?!";
"6daed";"*yaaaawwn*
...I'm so sleepy!";
"6db11";"Well, YOU look suspicious. That
tuft of red hair... Are you Adol
in disguise?! *laughs*";
"6db6f";"Y'know... You seem like you're
having way too much fun. Shouldn't
you be working?";
"6dbc7";"That empty room over there is
my bedroom. I called it, so
you can't have it!";
"6dc1b";"The empty room over there is actually
my bathroom. That's what I've been using
it for, anyway!";
"6dc81";"All these rooms, and every one
of 'em is totally empty!";
"6dcbf";"This place has a rather slummy
vibe, doesn't it?";
"6dcf7";"I swear, someday I'll
go traveling.";
"6dd21";"This place is basically unused.
It's pretty much a bunch of
closets!";
"6dd6d";"Why are the humans
here?";
"6dd8d";"These fruits are so yummy, I
just can't stop eating them!";
"6ddcd";"Mmmmm! Delicious!
Absolutely amazing!";
"6ddf9";"I know I should've been watching
more carefully, but...another fruit's
been taken by the human.";
"6de5f";"Wasn't you, was it?";
"6de79";"Someone's been stealing all
the fruit we've gathered.";
"6deb5";"Someone's been eating all
our fruit!";
"6dee1";"Dammit! It's gone again!";
"6df01";"Were more fruits randomly eaten?
I swear, we just can't seem to
get the situation under control!";
"6df69";"Don't you think this Shrine is
too big? It's way too easy to
get lost in here!";
"6dfbf";"...I think I'm lost. Ahh, whatever.
Not like I have any place to be,
you know?";
"6e015";"This Shrine is way too huge. And its
layout seems so random and haphazard!
It's so 24 years ago...";
"6e07f";"How do you get to the main area of the
Shrine? Pfft... How the hell would I
know?! I don't even know where I am!";
"6e0f7";"Main building? What, is food served
there or something?";
"6e135";"...And, uh, haven't I seen
you around before?";
"6e169";"If you have the pendant, you
can reach the inner Shrine.";
"6e1a9";"...Though you didn't hear that
from me, capish?";
"6e1df";"They're marked by the pendants
worn around their necks.";
"6e21d";"The central Shrine is only open
to specific people.";
"6e257";"...So why wasn't I chosen?
Am I not good enough?!";
"6e28f";"I hear that only 'chosen' ones
get to enter the Central Shrine.";
"6e2d5";"What's that? A hotel
or something?";
"6e2ff";"Central Shrine?";
"6e315";"Do you have the pendant?
Ah, okay. Just checking.";
"6e34d";"But now...it's under MY jurisdiction!";
"6e379";"This area was supposedly once
under Priest Dabbie's
jurisdiction.";
"6e3c1";"...Aren't I smart? Isn't it awesome
that I know that?";
"6e3fd";"Dabbie was one of the
six Priests of Ys.";
"6e42d";"...Or so I've been told.
But what does it matter?
That was a long time ago!";
"6e47f";"Priest Dabbie once controlled
this area.";
"6e4af";"None are allowed past this point
unless they know the password.";
"6e4f5";"So stop wandering around,
if you know what's good
for you!";
"6e537";"Nope, that's not it.
Who are you, and what
are you up to?!";
"6e579";"That's the one. I'll open
the gate for you right away.";
"6e5b7";"If you find him, report back
immediately!";

and seems to be hiding out in the
Subterranean Canal.";

and seem to be hiding out in the
Subterranean Canal.";
"6e9c9";"Heard a human managed to sneak in here.
Probably some bald marine or something.
That seems like the norm these days.";
"6ea45";"Adol's a pretty wussy name,
don't you think?";
"6ea79";"It's kind of hard, though,
to notice something like
that. Humans all look alike...";
"6ead3";"If you see a human with red
hair, that's Adol.";
"6eb09";"We should search every demon that comes
through here. Eventually, one of them
would be Adol, and we'd kill him! Done!";
"6eb85";"Supposedly, Adol can disguise himself
as a demon. So what's the point in
setting up blockades?";
"6ebeb";"This blockade is all Adol's fault. I
left something behind on the other side
of the gate, and now I can't go get it!";
"6ec67";"This whole area is my turf now.
If you don't like it, I suggest
you leave.";
"6ecb9";"This area belongs
to Mistress Zava.";
"6ece3";"But since Mistress Zava isn't
around anymore, I think I'll just
take it for myself!";
"6ed3d";"This area was under Mistress
Zava's control.";
"6ed71";"What are you doing in Mistress
Zava's precinct?";
"6eda7";"To defeat even Mistress Zava...
Is this Adol guy REALLY human?!";
"6eded";"I'm hungry...and you
look pretty tasty.
GET IN MAH BELLY!";
"6ee2d";"Mistress Zava...was so very, very
beautiful. But she's been cut down,
in the prime of her life. So sad...";
"6ee9d";"Mistress Zava is a
real looker, don't
you think?";
"6eed5";"I can't believe a mere human
would be able to take down
Mistress Zava... It's unthinkable!";
"6ef37";"This is Mistress Zava's
precinct. Are you lost?";
"6ef6d";"Heh... Not anymore, though!";
"6ef8f";"This building belonged to
Mistress Zava.";
"6efbf";"This is Mistress
Zava's room.";
"6efe3";"Hey, you! What do you think
you're doing?!";
"6f015";"If you have no business here,
you'd best mosey along!";
"6f051";"The demons around here are real brutes.
A small fellow like you should probably
get out while the getting's good!";
"6f0c9";"You look scrumptious...";
"6f0e7";"I'm so hungry... I should
eat me a good old-fashioned
Roo-burger! Yesiree!";
"6f139";"Are you...on the clock?";
"6f157";"What do you want?! Look,
I'm busy! Come back later!";
"6f191";"Quit loitering!";
"6f1a7";"Hey, where do you think you're going?!
This is the publishing house for our
gate passes! NO ROOS!";
"6f20f";"What you doing?! Get back to
your post at once!";
"6f245";"Why do we all need
separate passes?";
"6f26f";"Quit wandering around! Can't
you just behave yourself?!";
"6f2ad";"You're going to get in trouble, you
know. The gate passes are produced up
ahead, and it's REALLY off-limits.";
"6f321";"Quit wandering around. Adol's gotten
us all a little jumpy. Startle us
enough, and we'll bite back!";
"6f38b";"All right, go on in!";
"6f3a7";"But when you're done, get
back to your post, pronto!";
"6f3e3";"There's some big meeting going on up
ahead. If you don't have a pass, you
aren't getting in. Period.";
"6f44f";"...Passes, please.";
"6f469";"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";
"6f495";"It sounded as if no one could
see eye to eye, and nothing was
being settled.";
"6f4e9";"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";
"6f515";"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";
"6f541";"If Adol should get his hands on
it, there's no telling how much
trouble he'd cause...";
"6f59d";"That, by itself, wouldn't be such
a problem, but they also got away
with the #c2#Shrine Key.#c#";
"6f603";"The intended sacrifices
have escaped.";
"6f62f";"One misstep on his part,
and we will have him!";
"6f665";"The entire Shrine has been placed on
high alert, so that we may capture this
red-haired swordsman...";
"6f6d1";"They've been quiet since their escape,
too. No sign of their presence that
we've been able to detect.";
"6f73d";"But they were too
faint to make out.";
"6f769";"Adol heard voices.";
"6f783";"But Adol couldn't make out any specifics
on what was being said.";
"6f7cb";"Whatever was being discussed in that
room, the proceedings had become quite
intense.";
"6f827";"Sounds like it's getting
pretty nasty in there.";
"6f85d";"That's what one of our own's last
words were, anyway, after Adol gave
him a mortal wound.";
"6f8bd";"They say that Adol fellow's hair is red
because of all the demon blood. And that
his armor's stained in it, too.";
"6f935";"You want a taste of my
sickle? It can be a
practice run for Adol!";
"6f97d";"Get out of my way! Shoo!";
"6f99d";"If you see him, you're to
report in immediately!";
"6f9d5";"Supposedly, Adol's vanished.";
"6f9f9";"If you see Adol...
kill him!";
"6fa1d";"No one escapes my blade...
not Adol, nor anyone else!";
"6fa59";"The meetings here tend to
take forever these days.";
"6fa93";"They're gonna be in there
for a while, I think...";
"6facb";"Adol is stronger than us,
plain and simple. So we
just have to work out!";
"6fb1b";"They never seem to come to
any decisive conclusions.
It's a waste of time!";
"6fb6d";"Why do they even bother
having meetings?";
"6fb9d";"The blockade hasn't solved our
problems. If anything, it's only
made things worse!";
"6fbf7";"I hope they come up with
SOME kind of plan in that
meeting.";
"6fc39";"He brought up some motion that
needed a vote or something...
I dunno, I hate politics.";
"6fc97";"Have you heard? Apparently,
Lord Dalles is the reason the
meeting's taking so long.";
"6fcf1";"My money's on Mistress Zava.
All the time with her, it's
just yak, yak, yak...";
"6fd47";"Who do you think is making
this meeting drag on?";
"6fd7f";"Every time there's a meeting in the
conference room, it goes on FOREVER.
Demons can be really obstinate, y'know?";
"6fdf7";"There's no one in the conference
room at the moment. So why do you
want to go in there?";
"6fe55";"A very important meeting is
in progress right now.";
"6fe8f";"What business do you have in
there? ...I don't trust you.";
"6fecf";"There's a meeting in progress,
so keep your squeaking down!";
"6ff11";"What's on the agenda
for today?";
"6ff37";"It's usually Mistress Zava.
Good thing I'm not a betting
man, or I'd've lost this one!";
"6ff95";"Hah, seems Dalles is the one
responsible for this meeting
dragging on and on.";
"6ffe9";"If Lord Dalles were here, he'd
keep the discussion on track!";
"7002d";"Mistress Zava's probably
padding it out with gossip
and crazy theories.";
"7007b";"Looks like we're in for another
long, drawn-out meeting...";
"700bd";"And everybody's up in arms, now,
too, on account of that redhead.
If I ever got ahold of him...";
70123;"Mistress Zava is super-persistent.
When she decides to really argue a
point, there's no talking her down.";
70193;"Lord Dalles is the perfect balance for
her, as he absolutely can't stand idle
chatter. It's all business, with him.";
"7020d";"She doesn't listen to anything anyone
else has to say, and as soon as she
starts talking, she never stops!";
"7027f";"Mistress Zava's probably
dragging out the meeting.";
"702b9";"But I suppose I shouldn't doubt
my compatriots unless there's a
good reason. So greetings, brother!";
70323;"You don't look at all familiar.
In fact, I'd even say you look
kind of suspicious...";
"7037f";"You're...awfully cute. You know,
I hear Roos can do some amazing
things with their pouches...";
"703e3";"You know what Keith looks
like? 'Cause I sure don't!";
"7041f";"State your name!";
70437;"You're not Keith? ...You're Adol,
you say? Hmmm... I feel as if I've
heard that name somewhere before...";
"704a7";"Are you...Keith?";
"704bf";"...No, of course you're not. I just
thought maybe I could catch you off
guard if you were.";
70521;"Many of my comrades have been
killed recently. Watch your
back, or you could be next!";
"7057d";"Adol's been on some kind of
rampage lately. If I see him,
I'll make him regret it!";
"705d7";"Been a lot of us killed lately. Figured
I'd be dead by now, too. Say what anyone
will, that Adol guy can really cut!";
70653;"You're in the way. Move it.";
70675;"Stop wandering aimlessly like that. No
one's going to help you if you get lost.
...Mostly because we're all lost, too!";
"706f3";"Word is, Adol's gone into a murderous
rampage. It's WAY too dangerous to stay
here... I wanna go somewhere isolated!";
"7076f";"Quit wandering around like an idiot.
If you should happen to run into Adol,
you'll be one cute, dead little critter!";
"707eb";"What, are you lost? Wait your turn.
Someone will be with you in six to
eight weeks.";
70845;"I've heard that the madman Adol
has been spotted in this area.
I don't want to die yet!";
"708a3";"You just watch. I swear,
it'll be me!";
"708cf";"The one who finally takes Adol
out will be sure to get a big
promotion, I bet.";
70925;"But I'd rather spill blood
than have my blood spilled!";
70963;"I have no love for
meaningless battle.";
70991;"...Where I at?";
"709a7";"Having no sense of direction
is even worse than it sounds.";
"709e9";"Damn that Adol... I'll bet he's
hiding, because he's too scared
of me to fight!";
"70a3f";"Don't lose your head.
If you need to run, RUN!";
"70a75";"'Find Keith,' they tell me. But how
do I do that, when I don't even know
what Keith looks like?!";
"70add";"You go hunt down Keith, too!
This ain't break time!";
"70b17";"This hunt is a joke. The only way we
could really be sure we get him is to
kill every demon with green skin!";
"70b8b";"Ehh, I guess sometimes,
it's best not to ask.";
"70bbf";"Isn't Keith a demon?
So why are we hunting
him down...?";
"70bfd";"Shouldn't make a difference if just
one were to goof off...right? I mean,
no one could POSSIBLY notice...";
"70c6d";"There sure are a lot of
full-grown demons on this
hunt!";
"70cab";"But he managed to escape
through here.";
"70cd9";"I chased Keith down this way
a little while ago.";
"70d11";"The key to the Water Control Room is
missing. I wonder if Keith took it...";
"70d63";"What's that? You beat Adol?
And this is your proof?!";
"70da3";"What do you want?";
"70dbf";"#c2#Adol showed his own equipment
to the guards.";
"70df7";"I don't know what it's called. But
it's #c2#east#c# from the Shrine entrance.
Got that?";

building...oh, what is it?...the one
Priest Mesa used to govern!";
"70ebf";"Do you know where Mistress
Zava's room is?";
"70ef1";"All right, nice work! Go
and report this at once!";
"70f29";"...Hmm. It does match
with the description
we were given...";
"70f6b";"Maybe now we'll finally have
some peace. Go on, you should
report this right away!";
"70fc5";"...";
"70fcf";"You're an awfully busy
little chap, aren't you?";
71005;"It's you again.";

Something extremely important,
that's all I know.";

something that brought the meeting
to a sudden close...";

...Maybe I was just distracted! I
hope Lord Dalles doesn't find out...";

in, when I never saw you come out?!";

itself in knots!";

"717af";"My stomach feels like it's tying
itself in knots!";

"7181f";"My stomach feels like it's tying
itself in knots!";
71857;"So, what's new?";
"7186d";"Is it just me, or has it gotten
a whole lot colder...?";
"718ab";"Brrrrr!";
"718b9";"Whoa! I've never seen a demon
like THIS one before!";
"718f3";"I was born and raised in the
Colony of Lava, after all!";
71931;"Where are you going? It's way
too cold for me to go that way!";
71975;"Now hold on, mister!";
71991;"Do you want me to catch cold?!";
"719b7";"Tarf is no longer following you!";

you're crowding me a little?";

door, resembling a hydra.
It seems to be locked.";

to let you in, though.";

right through here.";
"71b2d";"#R#you1are1ninja#R#";
"71b47";"Whoa!";
"71b53";"What the...?!";
"71b67";"I think I should run...";
"71b85";"Hee?!";
"71b91";"Go away!";
"71ba1";"Goddesses~!";
"71bb3";"I'll fight, too!";
"71bcb";"I've been hit...";
"71be3";"I'm sorry...";
"71bf7";"That's...all I...";
"71c0f";"I'll knock 'em dead!";
"71c2b";"I ain't afraid of no monsters!";
"71c51";"Hee hee!";
"71c61";"Mister, you're super-cool!";
"71c83";"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";
"71cf7";"Bat your eyes a little, though,
and maybe I can pretend...";
"71d39";"Of course, it'd be even better if it
were from a girl...but I'll take what
I can get!";
"71d95";"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";
"71e09";"Also probably shouldn't let down my
guard to rummage through my stuff.
Perhaps if you'd come back later?";
"71e79";"I'd like to repay you, but I don't
really have anything to give.";
"71ec1";"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";
"71f35";"I'll have to keep thinking. Sorry to
keep you in suspense, but I promise
you, it'll be worth it in the end!";
"71fa7";"...And I think you might be
a little young for that!";
"71fe3";"I've been trying to think of something
to give you in return, but all I can
offer you are Zalem's measurements...";
"7205b";"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";
"720cf";"I'll keep at it, though! Sooner
or later, she'll be needing a
new suit tailored. Heh heh heh...";
72135;"...And sadly, the good miss has been
on her guard around me lately, so my
attempts at measurement have all failed.";
"721af";"I've been wracking my brain for a good
gift to give you in return, but all I
can think about is Zalem's physique!";
72227;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";
"7229b";"So what do you think?
Am I awesome, or what?";
"722cf";"Zalem's a cool 36-22-35. Pretty amazing,
no? She didn't make it easy to find that
out, either, let me tell you!";
72345;"And guess what? I did it!";
72365;"...You know, demons aren't the only
dangerous things in the world.";
"723af";"Adol Christins are pretty dangerous
as well. And no gift is going to
change my mind about that.";
72415;"I appreciate the gift, but I do
NOT appreciate the fireballs.
Keep that in mind, okay?";
72473;"Oh! Oh, Goddesses, no!";
72491;"...Thank you very much.
I greatly appreciate that
you thought of me.";
"724dd";"Thank you so much
for being so kind!";
72509;"Th-thank you...";
"7251f";"May the blessings of the Goddesses
be with you always!";
"7255d";"When thinking of all the hazards I
might encounter in my lifetime, never
did random fireballs cross my mind.";
"725d1";"Please try to be more careful
in the future, though, okay?";
72613;"But I suppose I'll accept this
as an apology, and forget it just
this one time.";
72669;"Please, do be more
careful next time!";
72695;"What in the name of the
Goddesses are you doing?!";
"726cd";"Oh, for me? Thank you! In return,
please allow me to offer you some
guidance on your journey.";
72731;"Still, it's not unreasonable to believe
that there may be some trace of those
powers left within our humble village...";
"727af";"Of course, in 700 years, the Priests'
bloodlines have likely become diluted,
and their powers lost.";
72819;"Indeed, if we were to research family
trees around here, some would surely
trace back to the Priests themselves.";
72891;"It's been 700 years since then, but
Ramia is still a seat of strong beliefs
in the Goddesses and the six magics.";
72909;"This village has a long history, dating
back to the time before Ys was lifted
into the sky.";
"7296b";"For me? Thank you muchly!
Please, allow me to give you
some information in return.";
"729c5";"I heard about it from their father,
but he passed away quite some time
ago. And so, too, have they...";
"72a31";"Supposedly, the siblings who lived
in the house next door were descended
from one of the six Priests of Ys.";
"72aa3";"Oh, is this for me?
Mighty kind of you!
Care for more info?";
"72ae5";"If true, that would mean the Goddesses
are probably the only ones who would
know how to exterminate them.";
"72b55";"Indeed, I feel that the demons we
see now and the demons that appeared
in Ys 700 years ago must be connected.";
"72bc9";"I'll likely never know the reason
for certain, but I have my own
theories regarding their Ys Origin.";
"72c35";"I've been thinking a lot about the
demons recently-- specifically, how
they came to be.";
"72c93";"Oh-ho, for me? You really are far too
kind! Let's see, what little tidbits
do I have for you today..?";
"72cff";"I think it's up to each of us to
consider questions like these, and
find our own answers.";
"72d5f";"And why do the demons exist, for that
matter? Is there a purpose? And if so,
does anyone know what it is?";
"72dcf";"All I really have to offer is a bit of
philosophical musing. Why are we born
into this world? Why do we exist?";
"72e45";"Ah, a gift? Thank you, thank you!
Allow me to give you some friendly
advice today, if you would.";
"72ead";"This applies to me as well. But I see
you're trying to make amends, so I'll
trust that you've gotten the message!";
"72f25";"It's basically common sense, but
when you set someone on fire, THEY
ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.";
"72f87";"Ah, a gift? Thank you, thank you!
Allow me to give you some friendly
advice today, if you would.";
"72fef";"One leaves a good impression with good
deeds. One rarely EVER leaves a good
impression, however, with FIREBALLS.";
73067;"Man down! MAN DOWN!";
73081;"...You're a good lad, giving a
gift to an old dotard like me.";
"730c5";"As thanks, you may have
unrestricted access to the
well in my basement.";
73113;"You're a very kind young lad,
to bring me a gift.";
"7314b";"...In exchange, how about I just
pass on all the life lessons I've
learned in my years? Let's see...";
"731b7";"If not for all the demons, I
could show you around Solomon
Shrine in return...";
"7320d";"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";
"7324f";"Today, I'll tell you all about the
many ups and downs of my life...
One hundred tales of battle!";
"732b7";"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";
"732f9";"Today, I shall regale you with one
hundred tales of my myriad love
affairs-- withholding no details!";
73365;"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";
"733a7";"Today, I'll fill you in on my rise
to glory in life, leaving no detail
of the journey untold!";
"7340b";"...Shame on you for striking
an old man like me! It's hard
enough keeping cool around here!";
"7346d";"Nowadays, all you whippersnappers are
nothing but a bunch of hooligans, who
throw fireballs and mess up my lawn!";
"734e5";"...Though I suppose even
a weak apology is better
than none at all...";
73531;"You're as bad as the demons
in Solomon Shrine!";
73567;"My bones! My brittle bones!";
73589;"A present for me?
Oh, my! Aren't you
just precious!";
"735c3";"...Though if it's a discount you're
after, I'm afraid the answer is no.
Business is business, after all!";
73633;"Bring me more, and I'll give
you a little something of my
own in return!";
73683;"I certainly couldn't refuse
a gift from a handsome younger
man, now, could I?";
"736d7";"A present for me?
Oh, my! Aren't you
just precious!";
73711;"But, disappoint I shall!";
73731;"If that's what you had in mind...
well, then I'm sorry to disappoint.";
"7377d";"Still, no matter how many gifts
you give me, I have no intention
of offering you a discount.";
"737e1";"A gift, for me? Thank you.";
73803;"The will to give to others is even
more endearing than the gift itself.
So thank you again, young man!";
73871;"You're never too old to enjoy getting
presents...though I'm not all that old
to begin with, of course!";
"738df";"For me, again? Thank you.";
"738ff";"If you keep this up, your real
girlfriend is going to think
she's not special to you...";
"7395d";"Ha! That's it, isn't it? You're a real
player, Adol Christin! And you're not
doing yourself any favors, either.";
"739d3";"...Or do you just indiscriminately
give gifts to everyone you meet?";
"73a1d";"This is getting to be a bit of a
habit. Do you have a thing for
older women or something?";
"73a7d";"You're giving me a gift?
Thank you very much.";
"73ab1";"I made it myself. Doesn't it look
scrumptious? I'm well-known around
here for baking great pies.";
"73b19";"Here, why don't you take this?
It's a Cruberry Pie.";
"73b53";"Are you just using me for practice?
Heh, well, you're good! And I do
honestly appreciate all the gifts.";
"73bc1";"Ha! I gather by that look that
I'm right on the mark.";
"73bfd";"...Or, these gifts are being given
to me by proxy, and you actually
have someone ELSE in your thoughts.";
"73c6b";"I'm getting the impression that
either you prefer older women...";
"73cb3";"...Oh, wait, you haven't eaten the
pie I gave you before? You should eat
that one before I give you another!";
"73d27";"You're a handsome man, so you should
have no trouble sweeping that girl of
yours off her feet. Now go on, eat!";
"73d9d";"I don't need your pity!";
"73dbb";"A gift for me? ...Whatever.";
"73ddd";"But if you do it again, then I'm taking
all my best merchandise OFF the shelves
whenever you walk through that door!";
"73e59";"I was going to double all my prices for
you, as revenge for the BURNING you gave
me...but I guess we'll call it even.";
"73ed5";"You're giving me a gift?
#w30#...Waitwaitwait, hold up
just a second...";
"73f23";"RE-GIFTER!";
"73f35";"This was from me to you!
Re-gifting it back to me
is extremely rude!";
"73f81";"Ack! Are you trying
to say I'm fired?!";
"73faf";"For me? My, how kind!";
"73fcb";"For me? You really
shouldn't have!";
"73ff5";"You're giving this to me?
What a kind fellow you are!
Thank you very much!";
74047;"You know, I'm still pretty badly
burned from that fireball you
threw. You think this is a game?!";
"740af";"I don't mean to be so judgmental,
but that fire magic really hurts!";
"740f9";"Nothing else holds a candle
to the pain I feel right now!";
74139;"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";
74195;"Makes you wonder, where the
heck did those demons actually
come from...?";
"741e5";"Some demons are actually smarter
than we are! So you'd do well not
to underestimate them.";
74245;"I used to think of the demons as nothing
more than dumb brutes...but that changed
after I was captured by them.";
"742bb";"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";
74317;"Your survival will always depend
on knowing how best to apply your
strength in any given situation.";
74381;"Some demons are immune to physical
attacks, while others can shrug off
magic like it's nothing.";
"743e7";"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";
74443;"I recommend carrying with you a means of
restoring your spent power since you may
be far from a village when it happens.";
"744c3";"He who uses it cannot STOP using it
until all his force of will has been
thoroughly used up. Or so they say.";
74537;"The magic of the Priest who governed
'Spirit'...holds a power not so much
sacred as it is...something else.";
"745a9";"Those fireballs really hurt,
you know!";
"745d7";"What the hell were you thinking?!";
"745ff";"...You know, burns never
really heal properly.";
74635;"And you think a little gift is
going to make it all better?!
...Well, it's a start, I guess.";
74699;"I'm still in AGONIZING PAIN
thanks to you.";
"746cb";"Yeeeeow! Some like it
hot, but I do NOT!";
"746fb";"I can have this? Thank you. May
the blessings of the Goddesses be
with you on your journey.";
"7475d";"Maybe it's just name association,
but I swear that demon's actually
kind of...nice!";
"747b7";"By the way, do you know that green demon
named Keith? There was once a boy here
in the village who had that same name...";
74837;"I can have this? Thank you. May
the blessings of the Goddesses be
with you on your journey.";
74899;"*sigh* It's like those peaceful
days were just...a wonderful dream.
They feel so far away now...";
74901;"Theirs was that house in the western
part of the village. If not for that
tragedy six months ago...";
"7496b";"So if you were curious to learn more
about that Keith fellow, he actually
lived here with his sister, Marle.";
"749df";"This is for me? My, you're so
very kind and thoughtful!";
"74a1d";"I believe that brother and sister-- you
know, Keith and Marle-- were descended
from one of the six Priests of Ys.";
"74a95";"I have no new information for you
today...not factual information,
anyway. But I have a theory!";
"74afb";"I sense that you are rich with
the blessings of the Goddesses.";
"74b41";"...Between getting captured by demons
and having my savior PELT ME WITH FIRE,
it's a wonder I'm still alive at all!";
"74bbb";"Thank you. I'll accept
this as your apology.";
"74bef";"I hope the Goddesses are as
willing to forgive you your
transgressions.";
"74c3d";"Yipes! Why would you DO that?!";
"74c63";"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";
"74cad";"And if you think I'm lying,
try giving me something else.
See what happens.";
"74cff";"Just so you know, though...even
when I receive gifts, I really
can't give anything in return.";
"74d63";"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";
"74dad";"Not me, though! Heh.";
"74dc9";"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";
"74e33";"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";
"74e7d";"Not me, though! Heh.";
"74e99";"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";
"74f03";"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";
"74f4d";"Not me, though! Heh.";
"74f69";"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";
"74fd3";"Hahaha. No ordinary man would come all
this way just to give me a gift. Is
there something I should know about you?";
"7504d";"I guess that DOES beg the question as
to how I know so much about gift-giving.
But I don't plan on telling you. Hahaha.";
"750cb";"Generally, it's a ratio of two people
per village. And all you can really do
is guess which ones. So...give freely!";
75145;"Remember, I said people SOMETIMES give
you things in return for gifts. The key
word there is sometimes. It's not often!";
"751c3";"I guess you're hoping I have some hidden
stash of treasure, or rare information.
But I really don't!";
"7522f";"(Owww. These burns really hurt.)
...#w10#Hmm? You're giving this to me?";
"7527d";"What's this? Suddenly, the pain of my
burns is beginning to fade. Yes, my
burns are literally healing themselves!";
"752f5";"Hahaha. It's wonderful of you
to bring me a gift.";
"7532d";"Hahaha. Try to be more careful
from now on, okay?";
75365;"Hahaha. That really hurt.";
75385;"Ah, thank you. Please let
me know if I can assist you
on your quest in any way.";
"753db";"Is that for me? I feel kind
of guilty accepting another
gift from you...";
"7542b";"If there's anything I can do to help,
don't hesitate to ask. I can lend you
anything, aside from money.";
75499;"Is that for me?";
"754af";"...Well, I can't offer much in the way
of money or wisdom. But anything else,
man, and I've got you covered!";
75523;"Thank you. I promised I'd help you in
my dream, and you keep on making that
promise easier and easier to keep.";
75599;"Is that for me?";
"755af";"...Well, any way other than money,
wisdom, or strength. I'm pretty well
lacking in those three fields.";
"7561d";"Thank you. I'll help out in any way I
possibly can, so feel free to ask away.";
75671;"Is that for me?";
75687;"So yeah...anything at all!
Just ask!";
"756b3";"I'm also not someone you'd want to ask
for love advice. Aside from that,
though, I'm your man!";
75719;"...Well, any way other than money,
wisdom, or strength. I'm pretty well
lacking in those three fields.";
75787;"Thank you. I'll help out in any way I
possibly can, so feel free to ask away.";
"757db";"Adol...";
"757e9";"Don't you have something to
say for yourself? Speak with
words, not with gifts!";
"7583f";"...In my mind, I'm still putting
out all the fires you caused.";
75885;"Please be careful using your
magic around here. Seriously.";
"758c7";"Fire! Fiiiiire!";
"758dd";"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";
75949;"...Oh, you actually want information?
Crap. I was expecting you to say no.
I don't actually have anything to say!";
"759c1";"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";
"75a2d";"Your gift-giving shall remain
unrequited, I'm afraid-- no
matter how generous you may be.";
"75a8d";"...Like before, though, I don't really
HAVE any useful information for you.
I'm boring like that!";
"75af5";"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";
"75b61";"Strange people tend to know
strange things. And I'm not
really all that strange!";
"75bb9";"...Come, now, did you really think I
actually had anything for you? You're
far too gullible!";
"75c1d";"Don't go thinking a present is
going to get you off the hook.";
"75c61";"What was with your little fireball
spree? Was it an 'absolute power
corrupts absolutely' thing?";
"75cc7";"I guess I'll accept this as an apology.
But don't expect a thank you.";
"75d13";"Owwie owwie owwie!
That smarts!";
"75d39";"Oh, thank you very much.";
"75d59";"I shall graciously accept!";
"75d7b";"My thanks to you once again.";
"75d9f";"I shall graaaaaaciously accept!";
"75dc5";"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!";
"75df1";"I shall graaaaaaaaaaaaaciously accept!";
"75e1f";"Thank you for your contribution to
the 'Cure Jill's Burns Fund.'";
"75e67";"...I take it this is your apology?";
"75e91";"Well, now, thank you.";
"75ead";"...I take it this is your apology?";
"75ed7";"Eeeek! Help! Spike!";
"75ef1";"Oh my, is this for me? Well,
then, let me return the favor
with some travel advice.";
"75f4b";"Hadat might be a better choice. He's
not quite up to par with Regg, but
he's a lot less touched in the head.";
"75fbf";"I don't know if he should be your first
choice for support, though. He's kind of
kooky or quiet, depending on his mood.";
"7603d";"Old man Regg is probably the smartest
person in the village. He knows all
manner of obscure and esoteric stuff.";
"760b3";"Oh, this is for me?
Why, thank you very much!";
"760e7";"And if that happens, I'll happily
introduce you to my daughter!";
"7612d";"If you remain this kind as you
mature, you'll grow up to be a
truly marvelous man.";
76187;"Oh, my... For me?
Thank you so much!";
"761b3";"At this rate, you'd make a fine
son-in-law when you get older...";
"761fb";"If you keep giving me gifts, I'll
run out of dialogue options!";
76241;"Oh, is that for me?";
"7625b";"Take your time. Play it slow,
and get to know her first.
You'll be much happier that way!";
"762bb";"You shouldn't rush in to a
relationship, you know.";
"762f5";"Could it be that you intend all these
gifts as dowry for my daughter?";
76341;"I hate lawless tramps who call
themselves swordsmen. And I CERTAINLY
wouldn't let them marry my daughter!";
"763b1";"Are you a traveler?";
"763cb";"It ain't proper 'round these parts,
though. So no more firey shooty, okay?";
"7641d";"I guess I can forgive you, what with all
your generosity. After all, maybe where
you're from, a fireball is like 'hello'!";
"7649d";"AIUEO!";
"764ab";"What? For me?!";
"764c1";"So I guess I'll just leave you with
this: If there's ever anything I can
do to help, please let me know.";
76531;"This cheers me up a little.
I don't have anything on hand
to give in return, though...";
"7658f";"Thank you kindly!
Lately, I've been
awfully depressed.";
"765cd";"Thank you very much.
Umm...";
"765ef";"I don't have anything to give you in
return, but I hope you'll come see me
again. I enjoy talking with you.";
76661;"Thank you very much.";
"7667d";"Don't know much else about it...
but if a priest owned it, does
that mean it's been blessed?";
"766e1";"Supposedly, my friend Maria's bracelet
that she always wears once belonged to
a priest of some sort. Weird, huh?";
76759;"This may not be the ideal way to say
thank you, but I do have some juicy
gossip you might find interesting.";
"767cb";"Umm... That really hurt, you
know. Your magic, I mean.";
76809;"Thank you. This should help
soothe the burns you inflicted
upon me.";
76853;"Aieeee?!";
76863;"That's for me?
How very kind!";
76887;"If you don't mind hearing me
prattle on, I'd be grateful
for your company anytime.";
"768e1";"That's for me? How very kind! If you
don't mind hearing me prattle on, I'd
be grateful for your company anytime.";
76959;"You should see if you can find it.
I'll bet you can!";
76995;"Supposedly, he hid a precious artifact
in a chamber there, but it's blocked by
a barrier that only his magic can break.";
"76a13";"Today's prattle: One of the six Priests
of Ys governed the power of 'Light.' He
lived in the west section of the Shrine.";
"76a93";"Hmm. All right.";
"76aa9";"I can see you're trying to make
amends, so I'll take it. Thanks!";
"76af1";"Hmm. All right.";
"76b07";"I'll try to forget about
the...unpleasantness...
earlier.";
"76b47";"What the...?!";
"76b5b";"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";
"76bc9";"...But you certainly don't HAVE to.
People will remember you fondly even
if you're totally selfish!";
"76c33";"It's all well and good to go around
giving gifts to everyone, if you have
the time and money to waste...";
"76ca3";"Most people will like you
just fine, even if you don't
give them a damned thing.";
"76cfb";"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";
"76d69";"...Though if you DO bring me a gift,
I'll happily accept it, of course!";
"76db7";"Not much else I can tell you, so you
know what? You shouldn't bring ME any
more gifts, either! There's no point!";
"76e2f";"...Are you taking the time to pick out
unique gifts for each person? Well...
Don't bother! Generic is just as good!";
"76ea9";"What the hell are you doing
blasting people with fireballs?!
It's not right!";
"76efd";"Hehh?";
"76f09";"I'll forgive you this time,
but DON'T do it again, okay?";
"76f49";"That is all.";
"76f5d";"FIREBALLS HURT.";
"76f73";"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";
"76fe1";"Oh, that's it. You're
going on 'the list'!";
77013;"This is for me, is it?
Oh, my. Whatever shall I do?";
"7704d";"I can sense that you're a
warm and sympathetic soul.";
77089;"This is for me, is it?
Really, whatever shall I do?";
"770c3";"I'm afraid I don't have anything
to give you in return. But thank
you very much!";
"7711b";"You're giving this to me?
My, you're such a faithful
little guy, like a doggie!";
77171;"I mean, do you actually think an older
lady like me would have anything worth
your while?";
"771d1";"You might want to give gifts to the
younger crowd, though. They're much more
likely to return the favor.";
77241;"I just never get tired of
receiving gifts from men,
no matter how often it happens!";
"7729b";"How can you be so mean as to
attack an innocent woman with
fireballs?!";
"772e9";"Well, I guess we can forget about
the little fireball incident.";
"7732f";"But all the pretty girls will
hate you if you keep that up,
you know!";
"7737b";"Kids these days...";
77395;"...";
"7739f";"...Thank you.";
"773b3";"That's very kind of you.";
"773d3";"You're really
nice, mister.";
"773f5";"...Hey!
...Go away.";
"7740f";"...I hate you.";
77425;"Noooooo! Stop!";
"7743b";"Thank you. You're
a strong man.";
77461;"Rather, you must have a very strong
sense of morals, to think of others
at a time like this.";
"774c5";"...By which I DON'T mean physical
strength or raw skill...";
77507;"You shouldn't have...but you
did, so thank you.";
"7753d";"Watching you and seeing all you do
makes me feel...that you deserve more
help than you're getting, I guess.";
"775af";"Lately, I've gotten to thinking
that we should all be doing more
than we are.";
77603;"Thank you, Adol. If something were to
happen...if we were to lose you...I feel
like a normal grave wouldn't be enough.";
77681;"And even if you died tomorrow, I'd
never forget you. Never! You're
unforgettable, in every way.";
"776e7";"Not that that's going to happen anytime
soon, of course. You seem like you're
the type to live forever.";
77755;"Thank you. Would you be offended
if I were to leave some of your
gifts at the graves here?";
"777b7";"Of course, I'm only talking about
non-food items. I plan to eat any
food you give me myself!";
"7781b";"I just want you to know
that they're being put
to good use...";
"7785f";"Thank you so much.";
77879;"That's why I dig graves. Because I CAN.
It's what I'm good at. And we all have
our own parts to play in this life.";
"778f3";"Those of us left behind have to
carry on, and honor those who moved
on to better places.";
77953;"There's more to life than digging
graves and mourning the dead.";
77999;"Every time I see you, Adol,
it reminds me that there's
still hope for the world.";
"779f1";"You're the one who attacked me
with magic, aren't you?";
"77a2f";"Aren't there enough graves
here already?!";
"77a5f";"You're the one who attacked me
with magic, aren't you?";
"77a9d";"If you hadn't let up, I'd have
needed a grave of my own!";
"77add";"Ashes to ashes...";
"77af5";"Heh heheh.
Thanks.";
"77b0f";"I could come with you
and back you up!";
"77b3d";"But you know what'd be even better
than gifts? You could show me how
to fight an' use magic!";
"77ba1";"Heh heheh.
Thanks.";
"77bbb";"Her Cruberry Pie
is the best!";
"77bdf";"You know Miss Zalem over at the armory?
You wouldn't know it by looking at her,
but she's actually a REALLY good chef.";
"77c5d";"Here, I'll let you in
on a little secret...";
"77c8f";"Eheh heh. Thanks.";
"77ca7";"...is what old man Regg said.";
"77ccb";"You should remember that if
you're ever lost in the Shrine!";
"77d0d";"Solomon Shrine is divided up into
a bunch of sections, each under the
control of one of the Priests.";
"77d79";"Psst, listen to this!";
"77d95";"Mister... That really hurt!";
"77db7";"I know I said I wanted you to teach me
magic, but I didn't mean for you to
do target practice on me!";
"77e23";"Faiyaaaaaa!";
"77e35";"Thanks, mister.";
"77e4b";"This really makes me happy.";
"77e6d";"Thanks, mister.";
"77e83";"Almost as much as my daddy!";
"77ea5";"I love you, mister.";
"77ebf";"Thanks, mister.";
"77ed5";"We shouldn't tell Daddy
yet, though.";
"77f01";"When I grow up, I'm
gonna marry you, okay?";
"77f33";"Thanks, mister.";
"77f49";"It's really pretty...
You're gonna love it!";
"77f7b";"This time, I'm gonna show you my
favorite things in the world.";
"77fc1";"Thanks, mister.";
"77fd7";"Look, isn't it pretty?
I've got lots, so here,
I'll give you this one.";
78025;"Heh heh. Now let me show you
this treasure I got!";
"7805d";"...That really hurt!";
78079;"...That hurt a lot.
You're a meanie!";
"780a5";"Enjoy it!";
"780b5";"Eat it like a big boy, and
I'll give you another!";
"780ed";"Wait... You already have a Cruberry.
You should eat that one before I give
you another!";
"7814b";"Eeeeeeeek!";
"7815d";"For me? Yaaay, thanks!
I got a gift! ♪";
"7818b";"Woooo! I got a present!
I got a preeeeseeeent!";
"781c1";"Thanks, mister!";
"781d7";"I feel bad taking all these things
from you, though. So how about I
tell you something cool, as a trade?";
78247;"Okay, listen closely... This
is seeeecret information, so
use it wisely, got it?";
"7829f";"I bet with some mining equipment,
though, you could knock down that
cracked wall, no problem!";
78303;"There's a place in the ruins with a
treasure chest, but it's all sealed up.
You can only see it through some cracks.";
"7837f";"Thanks, mister!";
78395;"...Not interested? You have someone
else in mind? Okay, I guess... I still
feel weird about it, but thank you!";
"7840b";"I want to do something nice for you in
return for all these gifts, though.
Maybe I can introduce you to Miss Esca!";
78485;"...I'll take it. Thank you.
But don't think this makes
up for attacking me!";
"784d7";"...Just don't attack me again...
and...I guess all is forgiven.";
"7851d";"Man, this is my favorite shirt!
You're MEAN!";
78551;"If you keep giving me food, I'm gonna
get FAT! You should feed the birds--
get THEM fat, so we can eat 'em later!";
"785c9";"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";
78629;"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";
78689;"That's plenty, mister! You've
already made me super-happy!
I don't need anything else!";
"786e7";"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";
78747;"Thank you, mister!
Thankyouthankyouthankyou!";
"7877b";"Awesome. You gave me a present,
an' that makes you awesome!";
"787bd";"Thank you, mister!
Thankyouthankyouthankyou!";
"787f1";"Awesome. You gave me a present,
an' that makes you awesome!";
78833;"When I grow up, maybe you
can be my boyfriend!";
78869;"Thank you, mister! And not just
a regular thank you, but a SUPER
ULTRA DELUXE thank you!";
"788c9";"I hate you, mister!";
"788e3";"Phooey! Get it away from me!";
78907;"Ouch, that's hot!
You suck, mister!";
78931;"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give
you some information in return,
but there's not much I can say...";
78999;"All I've got are some words of advice:
If you should ever learn magic, don't
use it on townsfolk. We get mad.";
"78a0d";"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give
you some information in return,
but there's not much I can say...";
"78a75";"How about a few words of advice? Always
keep your adventure log up-to-date. It
doesn't take THAT much time, you know?";
"78af1";"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give you some
information in return, but my knowledge
has been just about sucked dry.";
"78b69";"About all that's left is to suggest you
always keep a Wing on hand just in case.
You never know when you may need it!";
"78be5";"Wow, you're just a fountain of gifts!
Alright, I guess I've got one more piece
of advice up my sleeve. But only one!";
"78c61";"Be sure to take note of this, lest your
MP drain away to nothing and leave you
stranded in hostile lands.";
"78cd1";"Some magic wands grant passive abilities
that drain your magic points just by
having them equipped.";
"78d3b";"Ahem. While I appreciate the gesture,
you attacked me with fire magic earlier.
And that really, really hurt.";
"78daf";"All right, fine...I have some advice for
you, in exchange for your 'kind' gift.
Consider it...a warning.";
"78e1f";"We may not be main characters, but we
have feelings, dammit. So STOP TRYING TO
BURN US, YOU PYROMANIACAL JACKASS.";
"78e97";"What?! Who?! Huh?!";
"78eb1";"Buyin' some gossip, eh? Well, you know
Roos, those cute little critters? Turns
out they live in cute little TOWNS!";
"78f2b";"Gossip your game, is it? Well, you sure
know how to light my Masontorch! You
hear what the demons have been doing?";
"78fa5";"They've been kidnapping people, out of
the blue! Supposedly to be used for some
sort of sacrificial ceremony. Scary!";
79021;"Why, thank you muchly, good sir! You're
so very generous. Or are you just very
curious, perhaps?";
79089;"Maybe that's where the demons live!";
"790b3";"My sources tell me the kidnap victims
have all been taken to the Shrine of
Solomon, high atop the mountains.";
79127;"Oh, NOW you're being nice to me!
Are you a servant for the demons
or something?!";
"7917f";"...I suppose I can accept this
gift as your apology. Just don't
let it happen again!";
"791db";"Maybe I should spread some
nasty rumors about you...
See how YOU like it!";
"7922b";"Well, now, this is a surprise,
after all those rumors about you
being evil incarnate. Heh heh heh.";
79295;"But I'll let it slide...
just this once.";
"792c5";"Good thing I held off on spreading
that around the village, or you'd
have an angry mob after you!";
"7932d";"Ow! Stop it! Despite my name,
I AM NOT A TORCH!";
79363;"This is for me? I...I don't know
what to say. Thank you!";
"793a3";"Just so you know, while I DO appreciate
your generosity, I have no intention of
giving you anything in return.";
79419;"It's a personal policy. I hate social
obligations like that. Sorry! I hope
you don't think any less of me.";
"7948b";"I'll accept your gift, but I'm afraid I
won't be giving you anything in return.
I'm sorry. I hope you're not mad!";
79503;"No matter how much you give me, you're
not getting anything in return. I'm not
like other NPCs that way, I swear!";
"7957b";"You might as well stop giving me gifts.
It's not like I'm concealing some sort
of secret or anything...";
"795e9";"*sigh* Okay, you win. I'll let you
in on a well-kept secret. A REAL one,
too-- not one of those obvious ones!";
"7965d";"Apparently, they've even been
eating gold coins lately!";
"7969b";"They tend to eat anything
that'll fit in their mouths.";
"796d9";"You've seen the ducklings
that wander around Lance
Village, right?";
79723;"In fact, I believe one of them just ate
500 Gold this very minute! Why not try
bothering a duck? You might get rich!";
"7979f";"After what you did to me?
Yeah... More, please!";
"797d5";"Is this an apology? Well...fine,
then. I guess I'll forgive you.";
"7981d";"Help! Help! My ass is aflame!";
79841;"Oh, is this for me?";
"7985b";"Thank you. You're too kind!";
"7987d";"For me? Again?! I...feel kind
of bad for accepting so many
gifts from you, to be honest!";
"798dd";"Full of treasure, they are! Riches that
are just sitting there, in out-of-the-
way locations. So explore thoroughly!";
79959;"I guess I can give you some good info,
at the very least. You know Moondoria,
and the Rasteenie Mine?";
"799c5";"You got a thing for me? Haha! No, I'm
just kidding. I know you simply wish to
express your admiration of me!";
"79a39";"Have you found that one? If not...
you should look for it. Trust me,
it'll be fun! You'll be glad you did!";
"79aab";"Apparently, amongst all the treasure
boxes, there's one that's...just a box.
No treasure.";
"79b0b";"So, yeah, I'll let you in on a little
secret. The deepest caverns of Rasteenie
Mine are full to the brim with treasure.";
"79b89";"Mood swing much?!";
"79ba1";"I'm all for practical jokes, but FIRE-
BALLS AREN'T FUNNY. And offering me a
gift, while kind, will do you no favors!";
"79c1d";"You can gift me up 'til there are no
gifts left to give, but it still won't
make up for SETTING ME ON FIRE.";
"79c8f";"...Seriously, what the hell
were you thinking?!";
"79cc5";"Yeeeeeeeooowwch!";
"79cdd";"A gift? For me? Oh, what
a kind young gentleman!";
"79d15";"Oh, another for me?
Thank you so much!";
"79d43";"Oh, dear... You've gone
from generous to creepy.
But in a good way!";
"79d8d";"Oh, my dear...";
"79da3";"Are you, perhaps...?";
"79dbf";"Ooh-hoo-hoo! I'm flattered, really I am.
But I'm afraid I'm already married...
I'm so sorry!";
"79e23";"Stay away! Don't get near me
anymore, you creep!";
"79e5b";"...So you'll stop with the
fireballs, then?";
"79e8d";"Ouch! Oh, dear...";
"79ea5";"So this is...for me?
Wow. Thanks!";
"79ecd";"Oh... Is this a token of
your feelings? Thank you!";
"79f07";"Are you interested in me? You've been
admiring me from afar because of my
radiant beauty? Thank you so, so much!";
"79f7f";"So...you like me, right? Because I'm
the prettiest girl you ever did see?
You're so very kind to imply so!";
"79ff1";"So, you want to be with me? There's no
one else in the world who could bring
you joy? Stop, you're making me blush!";
"7a06b";"That was pretty HOT back there. Were
you trying to show me the HEAT of your
PASSION? Yeah, THAT'S what I THOUGHT!";
"7a0e3";"...Are you nervous and shy? Is that why
you burned me? Was it a hesitant burn?
A love fizzle, if you will?";
"7a155";"Ooh, it burns so gooood...";
"7a177";"Ah, thank you. You're a pretty
level-headed lad, you are. Well,
do take care!";
"7a1cb";"Such a kind boy. I will keep
you in my thoughts and
prayers.";
"7a20f";"I'm touched that you would
show such thoughtfulness to
an old man like me.";
"7a261";"As they say, what goes around comes
around. Your kindness will surely net
you great rewards in the future.";
"7a2d3";"...And not just from me.";
"7a2f3";"...";
"7a2fd";"You're evil, you know that?
Evil incarnate! That's what
I've been telling people.";
"7a355";"Kids these days, with their
fire and their swords...";
"7a391";"You're giving this to me?
Well, thank you very much!";
"7a3cd";"If only I were a little younger,
you might just have me swooning
for you, my friend!";
"7a429";"It's always nice to receive gifts,
no matter how old you are.";
"7a46d";"Oh, thank you... But what fun is
there in giving presents to an
old woman like me?";
"7a4c7";"Not that I'm complaining!";
"7a4e7";"Imagine, gifts for an old lady...
you haven't taken a fancy to me,
have you?";
"7a53b";"Old ladies and fire do not mix.
And gifts do not make up for
burns. Especially at my age!";
"7a59b";"Be more careful next time, lad.";
"7a5c1";"Ouch! What do you do?";
"7a5dd";"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";
"7a62f";"...But never mind him. This is the old
woman's story! And she lived happily
ever after. The End. ...Not bad, eh?";
"7a6a7";"One day, a boy fell from the
sky, his body engulfed in
light.";
"7a6eb";"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";
"7a72d";"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";
"7a77f";"...But the old woman knew nothing of
this, nor did she care. She was too
busy living happily ever after! The End.";
"7a7f7";"One day, a young man came down
the river, riding a small boat.";
"7a83d";"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";
"7a87f";"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";
"7a8d1";"...You'd think that'd fascinate the old
woman, but nope. She just kept on living
happily ever after. The End!";
"7a945";"One day, a boy sprang up from
the ground, mounted atop a
giant mole.";
"7a991";"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";
"7a9d3";"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";
"7aa25";"...What do you think? I love happy
stories. Especially when it seems
like there might be a sequel!";
"7aa8f";"He showered the old woman
with gifts, and made her
very, very happy. The End.";
"7aae3";"One day, a handsome young
man with red hair came into
her life.";
"7ab29";"Once upon a time, there was an
old woman living all by herself.";
"7ab6f";"You've got a lot to learn, if you
think this is going to make up
for tossing fire at an old woman.";
"7abd9";"...Even though it has.
This time.";
"7ac01";"...You're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";
"7ac51";"The moral of the story is, think about
the consequences of your actions. Also,
trust is earned. Do you understand?";
"7accb";"The old woman suggested he rethink
the purpose of the magical power that
had been passed on to him.";
"7ad35";"He threw fireballs at the old woman,
and caused her great pain. She was in
danger of NOT living happily ever after!";
"7adaf";"One day, a young traveling
swordsman appeared.";
"7ade5";"Once upon a time, there was
an old woman living all by
herself.";
"7ae2b";"Yaaaouch! Seafood soup!";
"7ae49";"Oh, my... At times like these,
a simple act of kindness can
mean so much. Thank you.";
"7aea5";"Oh, thank you. Not only are you
a seemingly very skilled swordsman,
but you're also a kind man!";
"7af0b";"There must be a reason you've
been brought to this accursed
land of demons...";
"7af5f";"You have a very unique air about
you. Did you come looking for some
sort of grand adventure?";
"7afc3";"Th-thanks... You know, I feel guilty
accepting all these gifts from you.
How about I give you some advice?";
"7b035";"Just remember that with every door that
closes, another opens. Even the worst
ending can lead to a great beginning!";
"7b0af";"Hardship builds character and gives you
the experience needed to persevere. In
the end, you'll always come out ahead!";
"7b12b";"Such a generous individual! Let me give
you some valuable advice...though I have
a feeling you might already know it.";
"7b1a7";"If you want good tidings to come your
way, definitely keep your eyes open.
Iron is a hot commodity around here.";
"7b21d";"Even if you find just a little piece,
that could be representative of a new
vein yet to be discovered.";
"7b28b";"You haven't happened across any
Iron Ore in the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine, have you?";
"7b2e5";"It's nice of you to give me this,
but please, stop throwing fireballs!
You'll put someone's eye out!";
"7b351";"Since you're the one tossing them, I
imagine you've never been hit by one,
but let me tell you...it hurts! A lot!";
"7b3c9";"I do appreciate the gesture, but please,
stop throwing fireballs, okay? You're
liable to kill someone!";
"7b437";"...I'll let it slide this time.
Just don't do it again!";
"7b475";"Hothothothothothothot!";
"7b493";"Ah, how kind! Please
accept my gratitude.";
"7b4c3";"Give readily, and you
will gain heartily.";
"7b4f3";"Speaking as the village elder, I would
be overjoyed if you'd keep this in mind
during your interactions with my people.";
"7b571";"But people love gifts. And oftentimes,
the shyest person will open up like a
book when you get a good gift in them.";
"7b5eb";"Most people are basically
selfish, when you get right
down to it.";
"7b633";"Oh, my, thank you. But please, stop
making such a fuss over me! Others
deserve such things more than I.";
"7b6a1";"Whether for good or ill,
I cannot say. I believe
that...is up to you.";
"7b6ed";"I'm fascinated by them as well. Those
two girls appearing in the ruins are an
omen...a harbinger of change.";
"7b75f";"Leggs, for example. He could use a nice
gift to get his mind off the Goddesses.
Not that I don't share his obsession...";
"7b7dd";"For me? You are far too kind!";
"7b801";"Perhaps your arrival is
also a portent of the
changes yet to come.";
"7b84b";"With demons all over the place, and
those two girls I saw at the ruins...
I just don't know what's what anymore!";
"7b8c3";"Lance Village may not be the
only place that's affected. It
could be the whole land of Ys.";
"7b925";"In the days since you've arrived
here, strange occurrences have
been afoot.";
"7b977";"For me? Oh, thank you
so much!";
"7b99d";"Perhaps my prayers were answered.
I prayed that the Goddesses would
come to us in our time of need.";
"7ba07";"I have to wonder if the two girls
I saw in Moondoria were just an
illusion...or my imagination.";
"7ba6d";"Young swordsman...";
"7ba87";"If you keep setting my people on
fire, I'm afraid I'll have to ban
you from the village. You got it?";
"7baf3";"*sigh* Another gift? All right.
Thank you. I suppose I can overlook
the fireball incident.";
"7bb55";"But all use of attack magic within
the village is hereby prohibited.
Understood?";
"7bbad";"Et tu, Adol?!";
"7bbc1";"For me? Oh, my! You
shouldn't have!";
"7bbeb";"Oh, is this for me? You're sure
you didn't intend to give it to
someone else...?";
"7bc43";"Use that information well, Adol.";
"7bc6b";"Lilia's favorite flower is
the Marle Blossom.";
"7bc9f";"All right. Thank you very much!
In exchange for this lovely gift,
I'll let you in on a secret.";
"7bd05";"Well, thank you very much!
I do so love getting presents.";
"7bd45";"After all...you might just
capture a heart or two!";
"7bd7f";"You'd probably be better served giving
these gifts to a girl, though, rather
than crusty old me.";
"7bde7";"Uh, th-thank you. You know, you're
making me feel a little bad accepting
all these gifts from you!";
"7be51";"The only thing I have to offer is
my devotion...so there you have it.
I give my devotion to you!";
"7beb9";"I wish I could give you
something in return.";
"7beed";"You are just too, too generous! As
repayment for your kind deeds, allow
me to tell you all about our nurse.";
"7bf5f";"...I just thought you
might like to know.";
"7bf8f";"She makes patchwork quilts for fun, and
loves spicy food, but hates sour things.
Oh, and she's single, as far as I know!";
"7c00f";"Her full name is Sarina Rune.";
"7c033";"Well...thank you for this, but...
fireballs? Really?! Where's your
common sense, man?!";
"7c091";"If you want to snag yourself a nice
girlfriend and settle down, fireballs
are NOT going to help your cause.";
"7c103";"Oh, for me? Thank you. I accept
your apology. Now please, don't
set me on fire anymore, okay?";
"7c167";"I'm meeeelting...MEEEEELTING!";
"7c18b";"I'll see you soon!
Best of luck!";
"7c1b3";"As for the medicine...
Well, I assume you'll be okay
to continue the search, no?";
"7c20b";"I'll make use of
this right away!";
"7c233";"With this, I can fly right back
to Lance Village. Thank you so
much for the thoughtful gift!";
"7c297";"Oh! It's...a Wing!";
"7c2b1";"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";
"7c311";"The more times you defeat a
certain type of enemy, the
more you'll learn about it.";
"7c36b";"Once you drink it, you'll be able to
ascertain the strengths and weaknesses
of demons merely by striking them down.";
"7c3e5";"I'm not sure where it is, but medical
legends (yes, we have those) speak of
a tonic called a [#c2#Bestiary Potion#c#].";
"7c463";"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";
"7c4c3";"If only there were a way to draw them
out into the open...but I'm afraid we
don't yet know how to bait a Roo.";
"7c537";"They now live in seclusion, hiding
whenever humans draw near. You'll be
able to sense them, but not see them.";
"7c5ab";"Supposedly, something happened to them,
giving them a demon-like appearance--
albeit a cute and fuzzy one.";
"7c61d";"There exist sacred animals in Ys known
as [Roos], which were once beloved by
the Goddesses and Priests.";
"7c68b";"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";
"7c6eb";"Who knows? With the Transform
magic, you might just be able
to make friends with the Roos!";
"7c74d";"With it, you can take the form of a
demon, not only allowing for infil-
tration, but also communication.";
"7c7bd";"One of the six magics of the
Priests is the spell of Wisdom,
better known as [Transform].";
"7c81d";"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";
"7c87d";"I wonder if there are still fields
of those beautiful flowers down in
the world below...";
"7c8dd";"The white Celcetas found on hillsides
bring love, while the blue moonlight
buds bring life.";
"7c93f";"Back when Ys was still part of the world
below, they bloomed everywhere. Whole
fields would be overrun with them.";
"7c9b7";"As I'm sure you well know,
the Celceta Flower is quite
dear to us...";
"7ca03";"...You burned my award-winning
beard with that fire magic of
yours, you know.";
"7ca57";"Since taste is mostly smell, all the
food I eat now tastes like burning
hair. Thanks a lot, pyro boy!";
"7cac3";"Oh, for me? Well! Thank
you very much!";
"7caf1";"I don't appreciate you hitting me with
that fireball, but as long as you're
careful from now on, all is forgiven.";
"7cb69";"That's...#c2#Roda Fruit#c#!";
"7cb8b";"To have found such a rare item... Truly,
you must be blessed by the Goddesses for
all you've done in the name of Ys!";
"7cc07";"My, my, you found it!";
"7cc23";"In other words, once we
have them both, we'll be
able to save her!";
"7cc6d";"If I can mix this with #c2#Roda Fruit#c#,
I'll have no trouble making that
#c2#medicine for Lilia#c#.";
"7ccd9";"My beard! My beautiful beard!";
"7ccfd";"Oh, it's for me? ...But, I don't
have anything to give in return!
Except...some information, perhaps?";
"7cd69";"Oh yeah, and if you do find any
ore, don't forget to take it to
ol' Guido's shop!";
"7cdc1";"If you have what it takes, you
ought to check it out sometime.";
"7ce07";"The old Rasteenie Mine's got some demons
all right, but there are also medicinal
herbs to be found-- and iron ore, too!";
"7ce85";"Oh, it's for me? ...But, I don't
have anything to give in return!
Except...some information, perhaps?";
"7cef1";"And ol' Guido is the best there is at
refining iron, let me tell you. He'd
buy the ore off of you, for sure!";
"7cf65";"As you'd imagine, Iron Ore is really
valuable these days. Doesn't do a lick
of good, though, without refining.";
"7cfdb";"This is starting to get a little
awkward, but thank you...I think!
In exchange, how about some information?";
"7d04d";"It'd be like attacking a ferocious bear
with a bird's feather, while garbed only
in choice cuts of delicious meat.";
"7d0c7";"And only Cleria can block its attacks,
as well. Without a sword and armor made
of Cleria, you might as well give up!";
"7d143";"The legends say that the true source of
this world's evil is almost totally
invincible. Only Cleria can harm it.";
"7d1bb";"This is starting to get a little
awkward, but thank you...I think!
In exchange, how about some information?";
"7d22d";"My deepest apologies to you.";
"7d251";"...That's what I'd say if I had any
information to give you. But I'm fresh
out, I'm afraid! My brain is empty!";
"7d2c7";"...I'm beginning to wonder about you.
But thank you, nonetheless. I do have
one more piece of information for you...";
"7d343";"Wait... That's the robe, right there!
Is that why you've been smiling so
coyly these last three dialogue boxes?";
"7d3b9";"Now, is that some obscure
information, or what?!";
"7d3f1";"Those who wear it steadily receive
the blessings of those spirits,
recovering health bit by bit.";
"7d459";"Supposedly, there's a type of robe
somewhere in Ys that's imbued with
the benevolent spirits of the dead.";
"7d4c9";"Yes, yes, that's very nice, but
FIREBALL ring a bell?! Watch where
you aim those things, man!";
"7d52d";"Thanks. Here's a tip: Armor doesn't
do much against fireballs. You just
have to be careful not to get hit!";
"7d59f";"What, are you looking for armor
that deflects fire or something?
You COULD just TELL me...";
"7d601";"What? You're giving this to me,
free of charge?! Thanks so much!";
"7d649";"If you have the time to stop and pick
some apples, you should. They make
great gifts for people!";
"7d6b1";"Oh, yes...just to let you know, in case
you don't already, there are apple trees
in the plains outside the village.";
"7d72b";"In all my years of trading, I've
never met someone as kind as you.
I'm deeply moved!";
"7d787";"What, you're giving this to me
for nothing? Why, thank you!";
"7d7c9";"The Shrine of Solomon is majestic, but
the view of the Ice Ridge is truly a
sight to behold. And so very romantic!";
"7d843";"You can get an absolutely incredible
view of the world around you from there,
as well as Ys itself.";
"7d8ad";"I hate to bore you with idle chitchat,
sir, but have you tried walking a ways
out onto the plain, to the overlook?";
"7d927";"Such kindness from a
customer makes me feel
proud of the work I do.";
"7d971";"Oh, you're giving
me this? Thanks!";
"7d99b";"If you butter him up a little,
he might share with you, too.
Worth a shot, no?";
"7d9f1";"Mmmm... *licks fingers* He smokes
meat like an artisan of butchery.
I just had some, and it's MAGNIFICENT.";
"7da63";"So I'm sorry to change the
subject, but do you know the
pikkard-keeper, Theo?";
"7dab7";"Such kindness from a
customer makes me feel
proud of the work I do.";
"7db01";"Now, look...";
"7db15";"There's a right place and a wrong
place for such things. You'd do
well to learn the difference.";
"7db7b";"What would happen to me if my
stock were to catch fire? Hmm?
You ever stop to think about that?";
"7dbe1";"Well...all right. Water under the
bridge. Just don't you be shooting
fireballs at me again, okay?";
"7dc49";"What the...?!";
"7dc5d";"Wh-what? ...For me? Really?!
No strings attached?";
"7dc95";"I see... I feel almost
embarrassed. But thank
you very much!";
"7dcd9";"Oh, I can have this? Thanks!";
"7dcfd";"With money, perhaps.
A lot of it, at that.";
"7dd2f";"I really can't give anything in return,
but if you were to bring me some Iron
Ore, maybe I could help you in some way.";
"7ddad";"Oh, I can have this? Thanks!";
"7ddd1";"And it feels so one-sided...
I'd like to give back, but I
just don't have anything suitable!";
"7de35";"I feel bad for taking from you like
this. You really shouldn't keep bringing
me gifts-- people will talk!";
"7dea5";"While I do appreciate your kind gifts,
they do NOT give you the right to burn
up my shop. So cut it out, okay?";
"7df1b";"With this, I suppose I can
forgive you for shooting me
with fireballs. I suppose.";
"7df73";"Ouch! That smarts!";
"7df8d";"Huh? You're...giving me a gift?";
"7dfb3";"I shall graciously accept
your generous gift.";
"7dfe7";"You know, I normally like my privacy.
Peace and quiet, and all that. But
thank you, nonetheless.";
"7e04f";"A gift? For me?";
"7e065";"...Well, if you're just giving it to
me out of the goodness of your heart,
then fine. I graciously accept.";
"7e0d7";"I'll be fine! And besides, I don't see
a wife with you, either. Do you even
have a place to sleep?!";
"7e141";"Is it out of pity or something?
Do I seem sad and lonely to you?";
"7e189";"Why did you come so far out
of your way to talk to me?";
"7e1c7";"Man, you're just a fountain
of giving!";
"7e1f5";"Fat chance! My solitude...
My peace and quiet...
Without them, I'm NOTHING!";
"7e247";"Are you trying to make me all
complacent so I'll let you live
here with me or something?!";
"7e2a7";"Well, thank you. I don't know
what your game is, but...
...Wait, are you...?";
"7e2fb";"So I can have this...?";
"7e319";"...Not that I'd...y'know...
be interested...in something
like that...with you...";
"7e371";"If you've got a crush on me or
something, you might as well just
come right out and say it!";
"7e3d3";"Well, if that's what you want,
I guess I should accept. But I
must know: Why? Why me?";
"7e42f";"Another gift, huh?";
"7e449";"...Fine. You can live here with me,
if you want. Just try to keep quiet!";
"7e499";"...
Thanks.";
"7e4ab";"Yeah, I'll take it...but can
I just tell you something?";
"7e4e9";"I can't stand guys like you.";
"7e50d";"You think everyone should fawn
over you or something, just
because you can use magic?";
"7e569";"Keep it down, dumbass!";
"7e587";"Oh great, he's got FIRE now...";
"7e5ad";"Oh, you're giving this
to me? Hmm? Oh, my, what
could this mean...?";
"7e5f7";"Well, stand firm and stay
strong, swordsman. And thank
you again!";
"7e63f";"Still, it's better than just fumbling
about at random, wondering what to do
next...wouldn't you agree?";
"7e6ad";"Plus, some people are ingrates.
They'll just take your gift, and
not tell you anything at all!";
"7e713";"Though we're a greedy lot. It's hard
to get useful information out of us
WITHOUT showering us in presents.";
"7e785";"If you ever get stuck, try giving
gifts to people. You never know
what they might tell you in return!";
"7e7f1";"Well, the least I can do is
tell you something useful in
return, no?";
"7e83d";"This is for me? Hmm...
What could this mean?";
"7e871";"You might discover a newfound
purpose for items you previously
assumed to be useless!";
"7e8cd";"If you're ever REALLY stuck, try
using all of the items at your
disposal, everywhere you go.";
"7e931";"Well, the least I can do is
tell you something useful in
return, no?";
"7e97d";"You're giving this to me?
Oh-ho... Whatever could this
mean, I wonder...?";
"7e9cd";"That's really all I can come up with,
at this point. If you want to know
more, try giving stuff to other people!";
"7ea45";"They're going to start thinking
you're some kind of lady-killer!";
"7ea8d";"You're giving gifts to just about
every girl you see, aren't you? I
wouldn't press my luck, if I were you!";
"7eaff";"Interesting, interesting... Who ARE
you, Adol Christin? You're the complete
opposite of every other guy I've met!";
"7eb77";"You need to act more mature, good sir.
The slightest misstep can start a nasty
wave of gossip, after all!";
"7ebe7";"So...are you interested in me, then?
And if so, I must know, how do you
intend to break the news to Lilia?";
"7ec59";"If you want me to have it, I'll take
it, gladly...but I have nothing else
to tell you, I'm afraid.";
"7ecc3";"Again with the gifts?";
"7ecdf";"I'll be looking forward to
seeing how this pans out,
Adol Christin.";
"7ed29";"If you're still interested in me, I'll
be happy to court you then. If you even
remember me at that point, anyway!";
"7eda1";"Why don't you wait a while, and give
yourself some time to grow up...#w30#then
come back, and see what I think of you.";
"7ee1f";"You're a teenager, and teenage boys
looove to pine away for older women.
So I'm like...a trophy to you, right?";
"7ee95";"...I think I see what's
going on here!";
"7eec3";"Since you won't stop playing with fire,
you leave me no choice. I'll not accept
your gift...but I WILL confiscate it!";
"7ef3f";"If you want me to forgive you, buy
me something more expensive, please.
I think you owe me that much.";
"7efab";"Your apology for playing with fire?
Are you trying to toy with me, boy?";
"7eff9";"...Keep 'em coming. Enough gifts,
and I might start to think about
possibly forgiving you one day.";
"7f063";"You're giving this to me?";
"7f083";"Take it to him, please.";
"7f0a1";"I can't take this. Dr. Flair
needs it to make the #c2#medicine
for Lilia#c#!";
"7f0f5";"Don't play with fire, son,
or you might get burned...";
"7f131";"A gift?! I-I don't know
what to say!";
"7f15d";"...I guess...thank you! I'll say thank
you, and accept, since you went to all
the trouble of getting it for me!";
"7f1d3";"A gift?! I-I don't know
what to say!";
"7f1ff";"Please, though, don't concern
yourself with me any further.
This is just too much!";
"7f259";"...I guess...thank you! I'll say thank
you, and accept, since you went to all
the trouble of getting it for me!";
"7f2cf";"Another gift? Oh, my... Adol,
you are just too much!";
"7f30b";"...And you know, Lilia has really
taken a shining to you lately. How,
uh...do you feel about her?";
"7f373";"But if it's that important
to you, I humbly accept!";
"7f3ad";"Another gift? Oh, my... Adol,
you are just too much!";
"7f3e9";"She really wants to be there
for you. You should...be there
for her, too.";
"7f439";"Though lately, I must say, I've noticed
that Lilia is... Well, she's gotten
quite serious about you, Adol!";
"7f4ab";"But if it's that important
to you, I humbly accept!";
"7f4e5";"Yet another one? Oh, my...";
"7f507";"Or do you actually have feelings for
me? If you do...I must admit, I'm
genuinely flattered. But not interested!";
"7f57d";"I wonder if I'm not just serving
as a proxy for Lilia in your mind,
Adol Christin...";
"7f5d9";"Adol, have you been doing this
for everyone in the village?";
"7f61b";"...The fireballs, I mean, not the
gifts. Though I'm curious about
that, as well!";
"7f673";"I shall humbly accept it, with my heart-
felt gratitude to you...on the condition
that you please STOP BURNING ME!";
"7f6ed";"Sweet death has come for me...
and knows of my sins!";
"7f729";"How very generous!";
"7f743";"If you continue on this path, I believe
everyone in the village will warm up to
you in no time at all!";
"7f7b1";"To show such courtesy and discretion
in the house of our beloved elder...
You are truly an upstanding citizen!";
"7f827";"Such generosity and thoughtfulness!";
"7f851";"If you keep this in mind, I'm
certain you'll find philanthropy
to be a truly rewarding hobby.";
"7f8b5";"Listen closely to what they tell you,
though, and you may learn something.
About them, if nothing else!";
"7f923";"But you shouldn't expect every person
to give back, of course. You must give
for the sake of giving!";
"7f98f";"Gifts are such wonderful things.
No one I know has ever disliked
receiving a gift!";
"7f9e9";"Is that for me? Oh, my... Well, as a
token of my thanks, how about I tell
you a story about the Goddesses?";
"7fa5b";"Anyway, that's the gist of it. Twin
Goddesses who watch over Ys, like the
twin moons in the night sky.";
"7fac9";"...What was I saying, again?
My memory isn't what it used
to be...";
"7fb13";"...";
"7fb1d";"Although we rarely ever address them
by name, they do HAVE names, of course.
In many ways, they lived just as we do.";
"7fb99";"Such a giving young lad!";
"7fbb9";"I'm afraid I don't have any other
stories to tell you, though. All
I can give you are my thanks!";
"7fc21";"You still give! What an amazing young
fellow you are! I suppose there is ONE
more thing I can tell you...";
"7fc91";"During your travels in Ys,
you may very well meet their
descendants!";
"7fcdd";"It's quite probable that
their bloodline still lives
on to this day.";
"7fd29";"Each of the Priests presided over one
particular facet of life: Strength,
Light, Earth, Wisdom, Time...and Spirit.";
"7fda3";"As you may well know, Ys was
created by the two Goddesses
and their six Priests.";
"7fdfb";"Was that fireball an accident, then?
You hold no ill will toward me? ...Very
well. I will accept your gift.";
"7fe6d";"Please just try to be a bit more
careful in the future.";
"7feab";"I see. This is an apology, then?
A show of good faith? All right.
I shall accept.";
"7ff03";"Please just try to be a bit more
careful in the future.";
"7ff41";"...";
"7ff4b";"Thank you, my friend.";
"7ff67";"We two are but passengers on the ride
of life. And when one wishes to sit,
the other shall politely stand.";
"7ffd9";"Superb. Care for a tip? There
are many, many doors down in
the depths of Rasteenie Mine.";
80039;"There's also a more average-sized door
among them, but no one's ever been able
to get it open before...";
"800a7";"They are the portals into the various
subsections of what's become known as
the Sanctuary of Toal.";
80111;"If the legends hold true, there's
a statue of one of the Priests of Ys
behind each such door.";
80175;"And several of them look alike.
They're big, and ornate...";
"801b7";"Splendid. Care for a tip?";
"801d7";"I didn't mention it last time because...
well, it accomplished nothing! But it
was progress, at least. Progress.";
"8024f";"Well, long ago, a few people managed to
force it open, but only the tiniest bit.
Not even wide enough to see through.";
"802cb";"There's a door close to the mine
entrance that's sealed up tight.
I told you about that, didn't I?";
80335;"You need to stop messing around, Adol.
The magic you've been given is of the
utmost importance to us all.";
"803a5";"It's not meant for attacking
helpless villagers.";
"803dd";"Very nice. I'll accept your
generous gift, but you need
to understand something.";
80435;"Fireballs hurt.";
"8044b";"Adol! What the hell, man?!";
"8046d";"Oh-ho, is that for me, sonny?
Ho, ho, ho! Been quite a long
time since anyone gave me a gift!";
"804d1";"Not since my last birthday-- and
as far as anyone knows, I stopped
having those YEARS ago!";
80533;"Ho, ho, ho! You are too kind,
swordsman! Too, too kind!";
80571;"Don't ever change!";
"8058b";"You like the Legg-man, do you?";
"805b1";"And you, sir, are one of the
wealthiest men I know!";
"805eb";"Those who respect their elders
are truly wealthy in spirit.";
"8062d";"Ho, ho, ho! Thank you! Young men who
appreciate their elders grow up to be
wise old men themselves, you know?";
"806a1";"Either way, there are apparently
six such chambers-- one for each
Priest. Collect them all!";
80703;"Collectively, the old Priests of Ys
referenced these as the Sanctuary
of Toal...or was it Thor? I forget!";
80773;"The Rasteenie Mine is peppered
with old ruins.";
"807a9";"How about I let you in on a
little secret?";
"807db";"It warms my heart to know
that you and Astal have been
thinking of me.";
80829;"I'm not sure where it's gotten off to
these days, but if you ever need to call
out demons, that's your ticket!";
"8089f";"What is the Evil Bell, you ask? Why,
it's a bell that summons demons!
...Yeah, those people were jerks.";
"8090d";"Back in my day, nobody ever thought of
ANYBODY else. People would always just
be ringing that Evil Bell for fun...";
80987;"Spare me your pity.";
"809a1";"Legendary brave soul my ass...
Honestly, who throws fireballs
at old men?!";
"809f3";"You weren't given the power
of magic so that you could
torment old folks like me.";
"80a4b";"A pity gift won't make up
for your heinous actions,
young man. Repent! REPENT!";
"80aa1";"Age and Fire make a
terrible cocktail!";
"80acf";"Whaa...? For me...?";
"80ae9";"I'm not s'posed to accept gifts
from strangers...but I guess it
won't hurt just this once!";
"80b4b";"Heh heh! Thank you very much!";
"80b6f";"Buuuut...you're not really a
stranger anymore, right? So
it's totally okay!";
"80bc1";"I'm not s'posed to accept gifts
from strangers, though...";
"80c01";"Thanks for the souvenir!";
"80c21";"Me and Ceres will always keep
you in our thoughts, mister!";
"80c63";"Thanks for the souvenir!";
"80c83";"Where are you going next?
I can't wait to see what
you'll bring back for me!";
"80cd7";"Yaaay! Thank you!";
"80cef";"You're the best, mister!
*smooch*";
"80d17";"This is why strangers suck!";
"80d39";"Burning doesn't taste good,
mister. Don't shoot me again,
okay? I don't like it!";
"80d91";"It tastes like burning!";
"80daf";"Whaa...? For me...?";
"80dc9";"I'm not s'posed to accept gifts
from strangers...but I guess it
won't hurt just this once!";
"80e2b";"Heh heh! Thank you very much!";
"80e4f";"Buuuut...you're not really a
stranger anymore, right? So
it's totally okay!";
"80ea1";"I'm not s'posed to accept gifts
from strangers, though...";
"80ee1";"Thanks for the souvenir!";
"80f01";"Me and Kris will always keep
you in our thoughts, mister!";
"80f41";"Thanks for the souvenir!";
"80f61";"Where are you going next?
I can't wait to see what
you'll bring back for me!";
"80fb5";"Yaaay! Thank you!";
"80fcd";"You're the best, mister!
*smooch*";
"80ff5";"Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!";
"8101d";"I didn't like what you did
with that fireball. Don't
do it again, okay?";
"8106b";"Owowowow!";
"8107b";"Oh, my... Is this...for me?";
"8109d";"Thank you so much! You've
made me so very happy!";
"810d5";"Oh, is this for me, also?";
"810f5";"Thank you so much, Adol.
I'm...#w16#really touched!";
"8112f";"I can't put into words how
special you make me feel.";
"8116b";"I'll always treasure our
closeness. Always.";
"8119d";"Thank you, Adol, for all
your kindness.";
"811cb";"I pray that you will always
be safe and well.";
"811ff";"Adol... Thank you. A thousand times,
thank you. My life is so much brighter
with you in it!";
81261;"Please take care of
yourself, Adol.";
"8128b";"I'll be thinking about you...
every day. Always.";
"812c3";"Umm...Adol? I've been meaning to talk
to you. Using fire magic against the
villagers is...well, kind of evil!";
81337;"Uh, thank you.";
"8134d";"Kyaaaa!";
"8135b";"Oh, my, how sweet of you!";
"8137b";"My, oh, my. I'll take it!
Thanks!";
"813a3";"Oh, dear. Thank you!";
"813bf";"You're a young one, Adol...
but you've got a good head
on your shoulders.";
"8140f";"I think I could fall for you, Adol.
I'm shallow enough to admit that
gifts are all it takes, for me.";
"8147b";"...
*smooch*";
"8148f";"What makes you think you have the
right to come in here and start
tossing around fireballs?!";
"814f3";"I suggest you leave and think
about what you've done!
Bad! BAD ADOL!";
"8153f";"...Have you reflected on your
actions? And are you sorry?";
"8157f";"Heeeelp! Police!
...Do we even HAVE police...?";
"815b5";"Oh my, is that for me?
Why, thank you!";
"815e3";"Thank you so much!";
"815fd";"...Thanks! I love it!";
81619;"I don't know, I'm feeling kind
of guilty taking all of this
from you...";
81667;"Thank you. I shall humbly accept.";
"8168f";"...You're a flaky one. Fireballs
one minute, gifts the next?
I don't trust you...";
"816e7";"...All is forgiven. Just
please, think before you
act from here on out.";
81735;"ACK!";
81741;"My deepest thanks.";
"8175b";"Lovely! Best wishes to
you in the future.";
"8178b";"Oh my... It's wonderful.
Thank you.";
"817b5";"Such a handsome, caring
young lad you are...";
"817e9";"Thank you. You're a very kind
man, to take notice of an
older woman like me.";
"8183d";"I feel like you and I...
might just have a future
together...";
81881;"Get away! Shoo!";
81897;"You think this'll make up
for the pain you caused?!";
"818d1";"...Fine. I forgive you.
Just don't shoot me again!";
"8190b";"Watch where you're shooting
that thing!";
81939;"That's most kind of you.
I greatly appreciate the
thought.";
"8197b";"Thank you.";
"8198d";"You have my gratitude.";
"819ab";"You're a nice man.
Thanks!";
"819cd";"Uh, hello? Inside someone's house?
FIREBALLS?! ...Yeah, a dinky little
gift isn't gonna make up for that!";
"81a3d";"That's most honorable of you.
Apology accepted.";
"81a73";"Goodness gracious! Great
balls of fire!";
"81aa1";"Oh, for me?";
"81ab3";"Thanks, mister!";
"81ac9";"Oh, for me?";
"81adb";"You're really
nice, mister!";
"81afd";"Oh, for me?";
"81b0f";"You're so kind, mister!";
"81b2d";"YOU BURNED ME, MISTER!";
"81b4b";"Oh, for me? ...Well, okay.
But I haven't forgotten
about those fireballs!";
"81b9b";"It burns! It buuuurns!";
"81bb9";"Thankth! You wanna go into the pen
and thee the pikkardth?!";
"81bfb";"Thankth! Next time, I'LL give YOU
thomething! Thound good?";
"81c3d";"Thankth! Here, I made you thome
food! Cooked it mythelf!";
"81c7d";"Wow! Thankth, mithter!
When I get older, I'm
gonna marry you!";
"81cc1";"Wow! Thankth, mithter! Will
you marry me? I don't wanna
wait till I'm older!";
"81d15";"...I got a little thcorched.
And it'th ALL YOUR FAULT!";
"81d53";"You can't eat me! Don't try
to cook me!";
"81d81";"You gotta eat that, okay?
'Cauthe I gave it to you..";
"81dbd";"It'th my own thecret rethipe!";
"81de1";"You gotta eat it while it'th hot...
You wouldn't want to dithapoint me,
would you?";
"81e3b";"...Oh, but you thtill have the
latht meat pie I made for you!";
"81e7f";"Eep! That'th not nithe!";
"81e9d";"For me? I can't give you
anything in return! Are
you sure about this?";
"81ee9";"For me? Hmmm... Well, okay!
I think I know just the thing
to give you in return, too!";
"81f45";"You should be overjoyed!";
"81f65";"Once she's grown up some more,
I'll let you marry my little
sister! How does that sound?";
"81fc5";"For me? Hmmm... Well, okay.";
"81fe7";"...Doesn't that just smell amazing?!";
82013;"In return, how about some of the
best smoked meat I've made all year?
I'll let you have...#w30#a whiff of it!";
82087;"For me? Hmmmm... Well, you've been
really nice, so okay.";
"820c7";"I'll give you some of my best smoked
meat in return. This is good stuff, I
promise! I'm an expert chef!";
82135;"...I like to eat meat. And I like to
cook meat. But I don't like to BECOME
cooked meat. Understand?";
"8219f";"Is this for me? ...Well, okay. I
guess I can forget that nasty
fireball business.";
"821f7";"Is this for me?";
"8220d";"...Wait, this is the meat I
gave YOU! Re-gifter, re-gifter!
Man, you're terrible!";
82265;"Go on, savor the flavor!
I dare you NOT to love it!";
"8229f";"It won't go bad, don't worry.
I used a LOT of preservatives!";
"822e3";"...Oh, hey, you still have some
from the last batch I cooked up.
Why haven't you eaten it yet?!";
82349;"This...looks like my
sister's cooking...";
82379;"You know, Lucy always said that
when she met her future husband,
she'd cook for him...";
"823d7";"...Is it from Lucy?";
"823f1";"Until then, go ahead and
enjoy her cooking. She's
surprisingly good!";
"8243d";"Well, she's a little too young
to marry you right now, but maybe
when she's older...";
82499;"Ah, so she proposed to you?
I see, I see.";
"824c9";"Until then, go ahead and
enjoy her cooking. She's
surprisingly good!";
82515;"Well, she's a little too young
to marry you right now, but maybe
when she's older...";
82571;"Yes, yes, I heard you the
first time. Lucy wants to
marry you.";
"825b7";"BARF!";
"825c3";"Is this a gift for me, Adol?
That's so sweet of you! But...
I kind of feel bad for Lilia!";
82623;"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";
82649;"...Or is that, perhaps, what
you're hoping for?";
"8267f";"Not that I'm complaining about all
the attention, but people will start
to talk if you keep this up...";
"826ed";"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";
82713;"Ohhh, what do I do? How do I
break this news to Lilia...?";
82753;"Um... Are you, perhaps,
a bit sweet on me?";
82785;"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";
"827ab";"Give me some time to think
this over, okay?";
"827dd";"Ohhh... How am I supposed
to choose between Lilia's
friendship and your love?";
82831;"...Adol, you're really serious
about me, aren't you?";
"8286d";"Well, that clinches it. I have
to follow my heart. I want to be
with you, Adol Christin!";
"828cd";"I'm just pulling your leg, of course. I
know that you and Lilia have something
special. I would never get in your way.";
"8294b";"...I'll bet you have this
problem with all the ladies
in your life, don't you?";
"829a1";"But I think we should wait
before we get married...
I'm still much too young!";
"829f5";"First you shoot me, then you
give me gifts... Is that any
way to treat a lady?";
"82a4b";"Really, Adol, I fear for Lilia
when I see you doing such violent
things. Fireballs, indeed!";
"82aad";"Stop! Don't! Get away!";
"82acb";"Thanks for the gift. You're
probably my twentieth best
friend in the world.";
"82b1d";"Thank you for the gift. Of all the
people in the world to whom I'm
indebted, you'd rank number six.";
"82b87";"Thanks for the gift. You're the third
most godlike person I know.";
"82bcf";"Thanks for the gift. Of all
the people I know, you're the
most...uhhh...";
"82c1f";"Hmmmm... What ARE you
the most of?";
"82c49";"...Do you see me as an enemy?
Is that why you shot me with
a fireball?";
"82c97";"I appreciate the gift, but I
still only regard you as a
casual acquaintance.";
"82ceb";"Aieeee! This is the
seventh most painful
thing I've ever felt!";
"82d31";"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";
"82da1";"I'd like to make friends with the Roos,
at the very least. They seem like a fun-
loving little race of cuties!";
"82e17";"So, why do YOU think the demons attack
us? Is peaceful coexistence really such
an inconceivable concept?";
"82e87";"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";
"82ef7";"I wish we could talk to them,
and get to know them...";
"82f33";"Do you think the demons ever
ask themselves that?";
"82f6b";"...So, why are we here, I wonder?
People, I mean. In this world.";
"82fb3";"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";
83023;"...It's because that's all they
know how to do! It's the only
behavior they've ever learned...";
83089;"By trying to put myself in their shoes--
so to speak-- I think I may finally have
come up with a viable answer.";
"830ff";"For some time now, I've been
pondering the question: Why
do the demons attack us?";
83157;"Is this for me?";
"8316d";"I'm on to you, bub!";
83187;"...You like hearing people
scream? And you think you can
just gift your way out of it?";
"831e5";"Is this for me?";
"831fb";"...At any rate, just be
more careful, all right?";
83233;"...Didn't mean to hit me?!
You were aiming right for
me, you lying little...";
83287;"Well, I'll take it, but...
don't think this makes up
for those fireballs earlier!";
"832df";"You wanna dance,
little man?!";
83303;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
83357;"Something about him just chills me to
the bone! You should definitely keep
your distance, if you can...";
"833c5";"Oh, I've been meaning to tell you... I
caught a glimpse of that man in black,
ordering around a whole bunch of demons.";
83443;"Well, all right... Never look a
gift horse in the mouth, as
they say!";
"8348f";"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
"834e3";"There's also another old man, Regg,
who studies all kinds of esoteric stuff.
But he's been pretty down lately.";
83559;"He's one of the most knowledgeable men
I've ever met. A real prodigy! If you
need answers, he'll have them, for sure.";
"835d5";"Oh, yeah, been meaning to tell you...
There's a guy named Hadat in Ramia.
If you're in the area, look him up!";
83649;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
"8369d";"She IS more of the tiny plains variety
than huge tracts of land...but she's
got a real nice, slender figure overall.";
83719;"She's about 5 feet 2 inches, and
weighs 105 pounds. But of course,
her measurements are a REAL secret!";
83787;"Want to know a little more
about her?";
"837b3";"First off, did you know Flonne's
my cousin? Yep, she is! She's a
real beautiful lady too, isn't she?";
"8381f";"Well... It's working! Here, come a
little closer. I've got some infor-
mation you might appreciate!";
83889;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
"838dd";"What do you mean, 'is that it?'
What more do you want?! I certainly
don't know HIS measurements!";
83945;"I mean, I know a little something about
Nash, I guess. He's the pikkard-keeper
here, and he's got a little sister.";
"839bf";"But...I don't have anything
particularly special or fun
to share with you!";
"83a11";"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
"83a65";"Heh heh heh... Some women
are just unattainable. You
should remember that!";
"83ab7";"Or maybe...you're trying to
sweep me off my feet?";
"83aef";"And just what do you think you're
doing? Are you trying to buy my
forgiveness or something?!";
"83b53";"I don't even want to see your
face right now. Get out of here,
you...you CAD!";
"83ba7";"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";
"83bfb";"Well...it's not going
to work! Not after you
tried to burn me up!";
"83c43";"...I don't want it.";
"83c5d";"Yyyyeeeeaaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!!";
"83c81";"For me?";
"83c8f";"I graciously accept!";
"83cab";"Thanks!";
"83cb9";"For me?";
"83cc7";"You shouldn't have!
But you did...so thanks!";
"83cfb";"Wow, thanks!";
"83d0f";"Eavesdropping is bad, though,
mmmkay? So don't do it! Even
if you can!";
"83d5d";"...What an item, huh?";
"83d79";"Here's a tip: When you wear the #c2#Whisper
Earrings#c#, you can hear even the faintest
of sounds from insane distances.";
"83df9";"Oh, thank you.";
"83e0f";"Heck, some even seem to have political
agendas! It's kind of fascinating-- when
they're not poised to kill you, anyway!";
"83e8d";"Some seem to be better
at following orders
than others.";
"83ecb";"Here's a tip: There are many
different kinds of demons.";
"83f09";"Oh, thank you.";
"83f1f";"Regg has quite the brain on him. Knows
anything and everything, it seems! He's
pretty much the go-to guy at Ramia.";
"83f99";"So, have you been to Ramia yet? It's
really nice. Haven't been there in a
while, though. Wonder how Regg's doing!";
84011;"Uh, hi, you BURNED me, remember?
You think a gift can make up for
that? Get lost, you creep!";
84075;"*sigh* Thank you. I guess this is like
an apology, then? As long as you don't
do it again...then...apology accepted.";
"840f1";"I'll pass, thanks.";
"8410b";"Searing pain?!
No thank you!";
"8412f";"Young people today are so polite.
Allow me to express my gratitude
by giving you a word of advice.";
84199;"You should always check to make
sure you unequip your magic before
going to sleep.";
"841f3";"If it's the type that gradually drains
your magic power, you may wake up to
find it...all gone!";
84259;"If you should decide to take a
nap to clear your head, be wary
of the magic you have equipped!";
"842bf";"More gifts? I'm afraid I don't
really have any more advice for
you, though...";
84313;"If you should find it, be sure
not to use it unless and until
you absolutely need to.";
"8436f";"I've heard tell that there exists a
life-restoring 'Elixir' in Ys...but
only one single dose.";
"843d3";"...Actually, there
WAS one thing...";
"843fd";"But since you made the effort...
I'll graciously accept. Thank you.";
84447;"Well...it's a start.
Thank you.";
"8446d";"If you sincerely regret your
actions, then I will accept
this token of forgiveness.";
"844c7";"...A gift? Well, I appreciate
the thought, but I have no
need of it. Sorry!";
84519;"If I clear my mind, it's
like a summer breeze...
with lots of pain.";
84563;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
84583;"Supposedly, the Priests made them in
order to help keep the demons out.
Pretty unbelievable, huh?";
"845eb";"Hey, did you know? The lava pits around
this village were created 700 years ago,
when Ys was lifted into the sky.";
84663;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
84683;"Souvenirs are nice, but I'd rather
have you tell me all about your
adventures!";
"846d9";"What's your secret? Are all
adventurers so level-headed?";
84719;"Mister Adol, you always seem so upbeat.
Even when the world's on your shoulders,
you're always happy and carefree!";
84793;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
"847b3";"Dunno where they live, but I'm sure
you've encountered some already, and
don't even know it!";
84817;"You should find the descendants of the
six Priests of Ys. I'll bet they've got
cool stuff they could give you!";
"8488d";"I wish I could give YOU something,
mister, but I'm just a kid. I don't
have anything you'd be able to use!";
"848ff";"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
"8491f";"The descendants of the Priests
probably do, though. They might
even know magic!";
84975;"I wish I could give YOU something,
mister, but I'm just a kid. I don't
have anything you'd be able to use!";
"849e7";"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
"84a07";"I dunno if he was serious or
not, but if he was, that is
SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME!";
"84a5d";"My dad was sayin' earlier that
he wondered if our ancestors
were related to the Priests.";
"84abd";"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
"84add";"Next time, though, if you shoot
a fireball at me, I'll reflect
it back at you. Pew! Pew!";
"84b3d";"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";
"84b5d";"Next time, though, if you shoot
a fireball at me, I'll bounce it
right back at your head! Sizzzzle!";
"84bc7";"Owwieowwieowwie!";
"84bdf";"This is for me? Oh, but I'm a
married woman... Are you sure?";
"84c23";"Well, they might have something to say,
though you won't be able to understand
them without being a demon yourself!";
"84c9d";"You say you want to talk to
the demons around here?";
"84cd7";"Well, I do appreciate it...but
I can't help feeling as if you
possess an ulterior motive.";
"84d37";"This is for me? Oh, but I'm a
married woman... Are you sure?";
"84d7b";"Not even the demons can traverse it
safely-- though they do, somehow. It
must be some manner of sorcery!";
"84deb";"A word of advice, too: If you're going
to spend time in the lava pits, do take
heed, as one hall is full of poison gas.";
"84e69";"Such a giving person, you are...
And yet I have nothing to give
back, aside from my thanks!";
"84ecb";"For me? Is this an attempt at
reconciliation for your prior
fireball-related misdeeds?";
"84f29";"Then...I shall forgive you.
For now.";
"84f55";"Oh, is this for me?";
"84f6f";"I do not approve, but I also
won't hold it against you.";
"84fad";"I presumed you my enemy, what with the
fireballs and all. I see now that you
simply have a warped sense of humor...";
85027;"I don't need it,
but thank you,
nonetheless.";
"8505b";"Vile fiend!";
"8506d";"A gift? Well, I can't just receive
without also giving! So how about I
give you some information on this area?";
"850e3";"Before that, when Ys was back on the
surface, we flourished as a halfway
point to the Shrine of Solomon.";
85153;"The lava's been bubbling
all around us for hundreds
of years, now...";
"8519f";"This village doesn't have any
special name. We just call it
the Colony of Lava.";
"851f5";"A gift? Well, I can't just receive
without also giving! So how about I
give you some information on this area?";
"8526b";"Keep a cool, non-demonic,
unpoisoned head, and you'll
do just fine.";
"852b5";"Lava...demons...and the
poison gas corridor.";
"852e9";"If you want to survive around here,
there are three things you should
steer clear of.";
85345;"Hah. I've gotten used to living
around lava. No little fireball's
going to bother me!";
"853a1";"If this is your way of atoning,
then I'll gladly accept it.";
"853e3";"Still, that wasn't very nice.";
85407;"Hah. I've gotten used to living
around lava. No little fireball's
going to bother me!";
85463;"Still, please be more careful
in the future, all right?";
"854a1";"Doesn't hurt a bit!";
"854bb";"What's this? You buttering me
up so I'll tell you everything
I know about the demons?";
85517;"Well, why don't you ask them yourself?
You might be able to understand them
if YOU were a demon, too...";
85585;"What's this? You buttering me
up so I'll tell you everything
I know about the demons?";
"855e1";"They're different from demons. They're
smart, and apparently sacred animals.
If only I could talk to one of them...";
"8565b";"Well, here's a little tidbit for
you. There are some cute little
critters around here called 'Roos.'";
"856c7";"Look... No. Just no.
Get the hell away from
me, you bipolar freak!";
85711;"Hmph. I'll take it. But no
information for you. That's
what you get!";
"8575d";"I don't know what you're trying to do,
but I'm not obliged to take this.";
"857ad";"How rude!";
"857bd";"Oh my, is this for me?
Thank you very much!";
"857ef";"My husband's going to be so
jealous...but that just makes
it more exciting! Tee hee...";
"8584d";"Oh my, is this for me?
Thank you very much!";
"8587f";"You don't need to make a fuss over
little old me, though! Your kind
feelings are gift enough.";
"858e3";"My hair's all burned up!";
85903;"A pox on thee, fire-starter!";
85927;"My furniture's all singed!";
85949;"*sigh* ...All right. I guess
I can't hold a grudge forever.
Let's just call it even.";
"859a5";"Hmmm... I think I'll pass.";
"859c7";"...Pay me no mind, please.";
"859e9";"Hey! HEY! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!";
"85a23";"Thank you for your kindness. I'll
make sure the rest of the villagers
act a little nicer toward you.";
"85a8f";"Thank you for your kindness. It's a nice
gesture. My husband is...not the sort to
give gifts like this.";
"85afd";"He's actually most well-known for
having his head in the clouds. Not
something to be proud of, that!";
"85b69";"Harumph. Be careful with
that magic of yours, okay?";
"85ba3";"Thank you for your kindness.
I believe this should cover
the damages, indeed.";
"85bf7";"...Thank you, but I must
respectfully decline.";
"85c2d";"...Are you trying to
cheer me up?";
"85c55";"I'll have to decline. But I
honestly do appreciate the
thought, very much!";
"85ca7";"I appreciate the sentiment, I really do.
But I can't accept a gift when poor Noit
is out there, all alone, in danger...";
"85d25";"Hey! Watch it!";
"85d3b";"You're very kind. They say one must
always respect his elders, and you
certainly are doing just that.";
"85da7";"Invariably, the answers you seek
can be found in the tired old brain
of an octogenarian.";
"85e07";"With age comes wisdom,
after all!";
"85e2f";"Every village is the same, in one
respect: If you want to know something,
you ask the old folks first.";
"85e9d";"You're very kind. They say one must
always respect his elders, and you
certainly are doing just that.";
"85f09";"And sometimes, that's just as important
as what came before...but not usually!
The past is better. Objectively better!";
"85f87";"They're sure to know what's
going on in the here and now.";
"85fc7";"If you've talked to the old folks and
you're still not sure what to do, then
you might try the younger farmers next.";
86043;"I can't believe you hit
me with fireballs!";
86075;"Don't go thinking that this
means all's forgiven!";
"860ad";"There's a special place in hell
reserved for those who abuse the
elderly with fire.";
86107;"I swear... What ever happened
to respecting one's elders?!";
86149;"Either way, thanks. At
least you're trying to
make amends...";
"8618d";"...I don't want that.";
"861a9";"It burns! More than usual!";
"861cb";"T'anks.";
"861d9";"Many t'anks.";
"861ed";"T'anks a lot!";
86201;"You're a poopy-head!";
"8621d";"You're a jerk-face!";
86237;"Owww, it huuuurts!";
86251;"Heh... You wouldn't just give me
a gift unless you thought you could
get something in return.";
"862b5";"Heh... You wouldn't just give me a gift
unless you thought you could get some-
thing in return. Well...";
86323;"...I'm not about to introduce
you to my sister. Sorry!";
86361;"Heh... You wouldn't just give me
a gift unless you thought you could
get something in return.";
"863c5";"Elle would be FURIOUS
if she found out!";
"863f3";"But don't tell anyone I
said that, okay?";
86423;"Ehh, but they're both real sweet
girls. Sweet on YOU, I think!";
86469;"You planning on hitting up the women
next? I wouldn't recommend giving a
present to Flonne. Elle's a safer bet.";
"864df";"Come on, now, really? After
pelting me with fireballs?";
"8651d";"...Those fireballs really
hurt, you know.";
"8654d";"I don't want any gifts
from an outsider.";
"8657d";"Agh! Ack! Awoo!";
86593;"Uh, okay. I mean, I guess it's
nice of you to do this, but it
seems a little awkward...";
"865f1";"Thanks, though...I think.";
86611;"We've all grown up in a pretty severe
environment, which makes for a close-
knit community.";
86673;"Once we accept you as one of
our own, though...you'll see
what we're really like.";
"866cb";"Generally speaking, outsiders
aren't...uh...welcome here.";
"8670b";"Make up your mind: Fire, or gift?";
86733;"What a cruel, cruel man you are.";
"8675b";"Please, just leave me be.";
"8677b";"What the hell?!";
86791;"Thank you...but what could I
possibly do for you in return?";
"867d3";"My apologies. I hope I didn't get
your hopes up too high. I'm just
giving you the facts-- nothing more!";
86841;"Unfortunately, where to FIND one
is a different story altogether!";
86889;"They provide immunity from poison when
placed over the mouth. Probably could
use one to get through the gas corridor.";
86905;"Hmmm... Have you heard of
the Roda Tree? And do you
know of its leaves?";
86953;"Thank you...but what could I
possibly do for you in return?";
86995;"Thank you. I can't do much to help,
but at the least, please allow me
to pray for your safety.";
"869fb";"You're just...#w10#an amazing
human being, Adol Christin.";
"86a3b";"I mean, not only are you saving
our land, but you're also giving
me gifts along the way!";
"86a9b";"...Thank you. You've made
me so very happy!";
"86acd";"Do your best, whatever may come.
I'll pray for your safety until
the very end.";
"86b23";"...But I know that our fate
rests with you. I can see it
in your eyes.";
"86b71";"I don't know the exact circumstances
of your fight...";
"86bad";"...Thank you so much. But...why
are you so kind to me?";
"86beb";"I've just been so lonely...
...
#w16#...I-I mean...uhh, nothing! Th-thanks!";
"86c3d";"I have to admit, I don't have a lot of
faith in the kindness of strangers. Or
rather, I didn't...until you came along.";
"86cbb";"Um... Just so you know, that magic
of yours? IT REALLY HURTS!";
"86cff";"A man of integrity, are you? Well,
then I'll accept your gift as an
apology for the fireballs. Thank you.";
"86d6f";"...How do I know about it? Oh, I was
chatting with Regg, from Ramia Village.
He talks about the strangest things!";
"86de7";"If the demons get ahold of it,
there's no telling how much their
strength will increase.";
"86e47";"Have you ever heard of the Black Pearl?
It's supposed to be the source of the
demons' power.";
"86eab";"I-I'm sorry. I...
can't accept this.";
"86ed7";"Nooooo! It's high school
all over again!";
"86f07";"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";
"86f29";"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";
"86f4b";"...I think you did...
but I can't entirely
remember!";
"86f87";"Hey, wait... You gave me a
gift before, didn't you?";
"86fc1";"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";
"86fe3";"...Oh, yes, I remember now!
30 years ago, wasn't it?";
"8701f";"Hey, wait... You gave me a
gift before, didn't you?";
87059;"I don't remember why I'm mad
at you, but this gift alone
won't make it better!";
"870af";"I don't quite remember why I'm
mad at you, but this gift alone
won't make it better!";
"8710b";"Ack! I will never forget
this horrible, horrible
sensation!";
"8714d";"Why, thank you! So,
what do you think of
our humble village?";
87191;"It hasn't all been sunshine and flowers
here for us-- especially in a lava pit--
but, be it ever so humble, you know?";
"8720d";"Why, thank you!";
87223;"...Though not from me. I've
got nothing, I'm afraid.";
"8725f";"Your good deeds shall surely
come back to you tenfold.";
"8729d";"Why, thank you!";
"872b3";"You'd be best off with a woman who'd
love you as you are, embracing the
bad with the good.";
87315;"You know, an older woman would be
a perfect match for a devoted young
man like yourself.";
87375;"Thank you again!";
"8738d";"One who would forsake all others
to live out her days with you.";
"873d3";"A hard-working man like you really
deserves an honest, earthy woman.";
"8741f";"Thank you again!";
87437;"May the road ahead be
blessed for you.";
87465;"...I'd imagine that even women with
beauty rivaling that of the Goddesses
would be unable to resist your charms.";
"874dd";"You're such a faithful man...";
87501;"All right. All is forgiven, then.";
87529;"Neither a lender nor a borrower be. And
if it means my fiery demise...then a
gift receiver I be not, as well!";
"8759d";"Um... Thanks, but no thanks.";
"875c1";"It's raw, so make sure you
don't let it get spoiled.";
"875fd";"It's raw, so make sure you
don't let it get spoiled.";
87639;"...Oh? Seems you already
have some! Well, then I'll
just hang on to this...";
"8768b";"Oh, no. No, no, no...
This is not happening!";
"876bf";"Hehh? This for me? Mighty nice of you!
Guess I shouldn't refuse the good will
of a friend...";
87723;"...So thanks!";
87737;"You trying to get into my
good graces or somethin'?";
87771;"Well, I accept. Thanks!";
"8778f";"...";
87799;"Thanks!";
"877a7";"...Ehh, probably shouldn't act so
suspicious. Okay, I'll accept it.";
"877f1";"What, you have a favor to ask
or something? You tryin' to
butter me up?!";
87841;"Wait no. 4";
87853;"Wait no. 5";
87865;"What, the fireball thing?
Fireproof muscles, man.
Didn't feel a thing!";
"878b3";"Now THAT'S a pick-me-up...";
"878d5";"...";
"878df";"...";
"878e9";"...What do you think you're doing?";
87913;"...This will do nothing to
help your cause. You know
that, right?";
"8795b";"...";
87965;"Fire...";
87973;"You're giving this...to me?
Thanks very much.";
"879a7";"Very well. I'll give you something
in return. Accept it with my graces.";
"879f5";"Even if we're not enemies, though,
is it not a bit unusual to bestow
gifts upon a demon?";
"87a55";"You're giving this to me? Much obliged.
You're a kind young man. Savor these
experiences while you can.";
"87ac3";"Always remember that you have a
long life ahead of you. Don't cut
it short by taking stupid risks.";
"87b2d";"This battle will require more
of you than simply slaughtering
every enemy in sight.";
"87b87";"If you're ever unsure of what to
do next, try asking around.";
"87bcb";"Let me offer you a
word of advice.";
"87bf5";"(...If my sister were alive,
she'd be around your age...)";
"87c35";"A gift? Again? ...Thank you.
You're quite a strange one,
you know.";
"87c7f";"I, too, will lend you my assistance
whenever and however I can. So please
do not hesitate to call upon me.";
"87cf1";"The hopes of many people rest
on your shoulders, but you do
not bear the burden alone.";
"87d4f";"Just remember one thing:
You are NOT alone in this
struggle.";
"87d93";"Despite my appearance, I am on your
side. But no other demon can claim
that. So be careful who you approach.";
"87e07";"A present? I suppose this is to make up
for the fireball? Have you realized,
then, that I'm not your enemy?";
"87e79";"As long as you know now,
I will consider the matter
resolved.";
"87ebd";"A present? I suppose this is to make up
for the fireball? You DO know I'm not
your enemy, right?";
"87f25";"I do not wish to die from a fireball
thrown by an ally. So please, in the
future, I'd ask that you take more care.";
"87f9f";"Stop! I'm not your enemy!";
"87fbf";"For me...?
Thank you.";
"87fdb";"Quickly, the final battle
awaits. I'll be fine;
you go on ahead.";
88023;"I'm afraid that all I can do in return,
though, is have faith in you, and pray
for ultimate victory...";
88091;"For me...?
Thank you.";
"880ad";"I'm sure a great many people
have you in their thoughts,
Adol Christin.";
"880fb";"Please, make sure you take care
of yourself out there.";
88139;"I have no way I can ever repay you,
but I am truly grateful.";
"8817d";"You don't even know me, yet
you risked life and limb for
my sake. And now you give!";
"881d7";"I cannot fathom why you'd bring me gifts
even after coming all the way to the
bell tower to rescue me...";
88247;"For me...? Thank you. I do
feel rather bad accepting so
many gifts from you, though.";
"882a3";"And no matter what, I will pray
for your health and success, Adol.";
"882ed";"...I'm engaged, so I'm afraid I
cannot return your affections.
You flatter me, though!";
"8834b";"Could it be that...you're
interested in me, perhaps?";
88387;"For me...?";
88399;"(At least he's making an
effort to atone...)";
"883cd";"Thank you. This makes me very happy...
Almost happy enough to forget the pain
from my burns.";
88431;"For me...?";
88443;"(Maybe I'm being a bit hard on him.
He is trying to make up for his
mistakes, after all...)";
"884a5";"Thank you. This makes me very happy...
I only wish I could feel the sensation
of it in my hand, through the burns...";
88521;"A divine light enveloped
Adol, curing his wounds.";
88559;"Quickly, the final battle awaits.
Worry not about me. Your destiny
lies ahead.";
"885af";"Am I to be a sacrifice to
the fire in your heart?";
"885e7";"Thank you, Adol.";
"885ff";"The final battle is at hand.
Stand firm, Adol.";
88635;"I have faith that when all is said and
done, this world will finally know true
peace. No more demons or monsters...";
"886af";"Today marks the end of our
seven hundred year ordeal.";
"886eb";"So, have you equipped the
Cleria Shield I gave you?
Don't forget, now!";
88739;"Thank you, Adol. Please don't feel
obligated, though. It was my duty
to bring you the Cleria Shield.";
"887a5";"Save your gifts. Give them to Feena
after the battle ends. Right now,
you need to stay focused!";
"8880b";"And compared to all that you've done
for us, it seems almost silly!";
88855;"Thank you, Adol.";
"8886d";"Though I must admit, that
fireball was uncalled for...";
"888ab";"Thank you, Adol.";
"888c3";"I certainly didn't sleepwalk to Ys
to bring you the Cleria Shield, I'll
tell you that!";
88921;"But don't you think there are nicer ways
of getting one's attention? Or did you
just want to make sure I was awake...?";
"8899f";"Ow... That really hurts!";
"889bf";"Huh? For me?! Uh, thanks, but
shouldn't you be focused on the
battle at hand?";
"88a13";"Get to it, Adol!
We believe in you!";
"88a3d";"Without it, you'll be in for a
very short battle indeed.";
"88a7d";"If not, then I recommend you go
talk to him right away!";
"88abb";"Which reminds me, did you get the
Cleria Shield from Luta?";
"88afd";"Hey, now! This is no time to
stand around handing out gifts!";
"88b41";"Do us proud, man!";
"88b59";"Last but not least, don't forget
to prepare your Shield magic.";
"88b9f";"Do you have all of the Cleria
equipment? You should also equip
the Goddesses' Ring and an Elixir.";
"88c07";"I appreciate the thought, I really do,
but you need to get ready to take down
that demon!";
"88c67";"What does this look like, a baby
shower? Get that gift-bearing ass
of yours to the final boss already!";
"88cd5";"Don't mess up, Adol!
Do us proud!";
"88cfd";"...What, you want some words of wisdom?
Fine. When you make your preparations,
check your wits AND your equipment.";
"88d77";"You know, I was glad to see you. WAS.
Until you blasted me with a fireball!
What the hell, man?!";
"88ddf";"I don't need an apology.
Just make sure you win!";
"88e17";"Well, we know your fireballs
work, at least!";
"88e4b";"I don't need an apology.
Just make sure you win!";
"88e83";"What the hell?!";
"88e9b";"Is this...for me...?
...Thank you, Adol!";
"88ecb";"Will you ever be able to forgive us for
forcing destiny's hand, and placing this
burden on your shoulders?";
"88f3d";"You're giving this to
me? Thank you, Adol!";
"88f6f";"This is to be the final battle.
Please, come back to me alive.
I'll be...waiting for you.";
"88fcf";"The best gift you could ever give me
is to stay just the way you are.";
"8901b";"You haven't changed a bit,
all this time...";
"8904d";"You're giving this to
me? Thank you, Adol!";
"8907f";"May the final confrontation
be won swiftly.";
"890b1";"This is just about all I can give you
in return, I'm afraid. Close your eyes,
and clear your thoughts...";
89121;"You're giving this to
me? Thank you, Adol!";
89153;"Fear not. I wouldn't be much
of a Goddess if a mere fire-
ball could take me down.";
"891ad";"Are you concerned about
the fireball you shot me
with?";
"891eb";"#c2#Adol gave a silent smile.";
"8920f";"...Thank you.";
89223;"A warm surge of energy passed from
Feena's body into Adol's, filling
him with strength.";
89281;"As long as it takes...
I will wait for you.";
"892b3";"I'll be waiting...";
"892cd";"This is the end. The final battle.
Please, come back to me alive, Adol!";
"8931b";"A warm surge of energy passed from
Feena's body into Adol's, filling
him with strength.";
89379;"As long as it takes...
I will wait for you.";
"893ab";"I'll be waiting...";
"893c5";"It's the final battle...
Please, come back to me
alive, Adol!";
89409;"Toasty!";
89417;"Is this for me?
Thank you, Adol.";
"8943f";"It's the least I can do.";
"8945f";"Please keep it, as my gift to you.";
89489;"And you're a real virtuoso with
the harmonica, too!";
"894c3";"You've helped the two of us
in so many ways...";
"894f9";"Is this for me?
Thank you, Adol.";
89521;"May victory and safe return be yours,
by whatever means necessary.";
"8956b";"We entrust our full power to you.";
89593;"This battle with Darm may prove
to be the most intense of all you
have faced thus far.";
"895f1";"I'm truly sorry for that.";
89611;"We've pulled you into a struggle
for a land not your own...";
89653;"Is this for me?
